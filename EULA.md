##AZURE COSMOS DB for MongoDB VCORE - PRIVATE PREVIEW

These license terms are an agreement between you and Microsoft Corporation (or one of its affiliates). They 
apply to the software named above and any Microsoft services or software updates (except to the extent such 
services or updates are accompanied by new or additional terms, in which case those different terms apply 
prospectively and do not alter your or Microsoft’s rights relating to pre-updated software or services). IF YOU 
COMPLY WITH THESE LICENSE TERMS, YOU HAVE THE RIGHTS BELOW. BY USING THE SOFTWARE, YOU 
ACCEPT THESE TERMS.

###1. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS

**a) General.** You may install and use any number of copies of the software on your devices, solely to 
demonstrate and internally evaluate it for your internal business purposes. You may not use the 
software in a live operating or production environment unless Microsoft permits you to do so under 
another agreement.

**b) Third Party Components.** The software may include third party components with separate legal 
notices or governed by other agreements, as may be described in the ThirdPartyNotices file(s) 
accompanying the software.

###2. TIME-SENSITIVE SOFTWARE.

**a) Period.** This agreement is effective on your acceptance and terminates on the earlier of (i) 
29/04/2024, (ii) within 10 days following first availability of a public release of the software or (iii) 
upon termination by Microsoft. Microsoft may extend this agreement in its discretion.

**b) Access to data.** You may not be able to access data used in the software when it stops running.

###3. SCOPE OF LICENSE.

The software is licensed, not sold. Microsoft reserves all other rights. Unless 
applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation, you will not (and have no right to):

**a)** work around any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways;

**b)** reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, or otherwise attempt to derive the source
code for the software, except and to the extent required by third party licensing terms governing use 
of certain open source components that may be included in the software;

**c)** remove, minimize, block, or modify any notices of Microsoft or its suppliers in the software;

**f)** use the software in any way that is against the law or to create or propagate malware; or

**g)** share, publish, distribute, or lease the software, provide the software as a stand-alone offering for 
others to use, or transfer the software or this agreement to any third party.

The software is a pre-release version. It may not operate correctly. It may 
be different from the public and/or commercially released version. It is not covered by customer support

not subject to the Data Protection Addendum available at [https://aka.ms/DPA](https://aka.ms/DPA).
###5. FEEDBACK.

If you give feedback about the software to Microsoft, you give to Microsoft, without charge, 
the right to use, share and commercialize your feedback in any way and for any purpose. You will not give 
feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license its software or documentation to 
third parties because Microsoft includes your feedback in them. These rights survive this agreement.

Microsoft. To learn more about how Microsoft processes personal data we collect, please see the Microsoft

Updates may not include or support all existing software features, services, or peripheral devices.

###10. BINDING ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER.

**This Section applies if you live in (or, if 
a business, your principal place of business is in) the United States.** If you and Microsoft have a 
dispute, you and Microsoft agree to try for 60 days to resolve it informally. If you and Microsoft can’t, you 
and Microsoft **agree to binding individual arbitration before the American Arbitration 
Association under the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), and not to sue in court in front of a 
judge or jury.** Instead, a neutral arbitrator will decide. **Class action lawsuits, class-wide 
arbitrations, private attorney-general actions, and any other proceeding where someone acts 
in a representative capacity are not allowed; nor is combining individual proceedings without 
the consent of all parties.** The complete Arbitration Agreement contains more terms and is at

###11. TERMINATION.

Without prejudice to any other rights, Microsoft may terminate this agreement if you fail 
to comply with any of its terms or conditions. In such event, you must destroy all copies of the software 
and all of its component parts.

###12. ENTIRE AGREEMENT.

This agreement, and any other terms Microsoft may provide for supplements, 
updates, or third-party applications, is the entire agreement for the software.

###13. APPLICABLE LAW AND PLACE TO RESOLVE DISPUTES.

If you acquired the software in the United States or Canada, the laws of the state or
province where you live (or, if a business, where your principal 
place of business is located) govern the interpretation of this agreement, claims for its breach, and all
other claims (including consumer protection, unfair competition, and tort claims), regardless of conflict of 
laws principles, except that the FAA governs everything related to arbitration. If you acquired the software 
in any other country, its laws apply, except that the FAA governs everything related to arbitration. If U.S. 
federal jurisdiction exists, you and Microsoft consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal court 
in King County, Washington for all disputes heard in court (excluding arbitration). If not, you and Microsoft 
consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington for all 
disputes heard in court (excluding arbitration).

###14. CONSUMER RIGHTS; REGIONAL VARIATIONS.

This agreement describes certain legal rights. You 
may have other rights, including consumer rights, under the laws of your state, province, or country. 
Separate and apart from your relationship with Microsoft, you may also have rights with respect to the
party from which you acquired the software. This agreement does not change those other rights if the 
laws of your state, province, or country do not permit it to do so. For example, if you acquired the 
software in one of the below regions, or mandatory country law applies, then the following provisions 
apply to you:

**a) Australia.** You have statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law and nothing in this 
agreement is intended to affect those rights.

**b) Canada.** If you acquired this software in Canada, you may stop receiving updates by turning off the 
automatic update feature, disconnecting your device from the Internet (if and when you re-connect to 
the Internet, however, the software will resume checking for and installing updates), or uninstalling 
the software. The product documentation, if any, may also specify how to turn off updates for your 
specific device or software.

**c) Germany and Austria.**

    **i. Warranty.** The properly licensed software will perform substantially as described in any Microsoft 
    materials that accompany the software. However, Microsoft gives no contractual guarantee in 
    relation to the licensed software.

    **ii. Limitation of Liability.** In case of intentional conduct, gross negligence, claims based on the 
    Product Liability Act, as well as, in case of death or personal or physical injury, Microsoft is liable 
    according to the statutory law.

Subject to the foregoing clause ii., Microsoft will only be liable for slight negligence if Microsoft is in 
breach of such material contractual obligations, the fulfillment of which facilitate the due performance 
of this agreement, the breach of which would endanger the purpose of this agreement and the 
compliance with which a party may constantly trust in (so-called "cardinal obligations"). In other cases 
of slight negligence, Microsoft will not be liable for slight negligence.

####15. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. THE SOFTWARE IS LICENSED “AS IS.” YOU BEAR THE RISK OF USING IT. MICROSOFT GIVES NO EXPRESS WARRANTIES, GUARANTEES, OR CONDITIONS. TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAWS, MICROSOFT EXCLUDES ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

YOU CANNOT RECOVER ANY OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING CONSEQUENTIAL, LOST PROFITS, SPECIAL, INDIRECT OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES.

**This limitation applies to (a) anything related to the software, services, content (including 
code) on third party Internet sites, or third party applications; and (b) claims for breach of 
contract, warranty, guarantee, or condition; strict liability, negligence, or other tort; or any 
other claim; in each case to the extent permitted by applicable law.**

**It also applies even if Microsoft knew or should have known about the possibility of the 
damages. The above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you because your state, 
province, or country may not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental, consequential, or 
other damages.**

###17. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

The software, including its user interface, features and 
documentation, is confidential and proprietary to Microsoft and its suppliers.

**a) Use.** For five years after installation of the software or its commercial release, whichever is first, you 
may not disclose confidential information to third parties. You may disclose confidential information 
only to your employees and consultants who need to know the information. You must have written 
agreements with them that protect the confidential information at least as much as this agreement.

**b) Survival.** Your duty to protect confidential information survives this agreement.

**c) Exclusions.** You may disclose confidential information in response to a judicial or governmental 
order. You must first give written notice to Microsoft to allow it to seek a protective order or otherwise 
protect the information. Confidential information does not include information that:

  **i.** becomes publicly known through no wrongful act;

  **ii.** you received from a third party who did not breach confidentiality obligations to Microsoft or its 
  suppliers; or

  **iii.** you developed independently

   stricte, de négligence ou d’une autre faute dans la limite autorisée par la loi en vigueur.**

**Elle s’applique également, même si Microsoft connaissait ou devrait connaître l’éventualité d’un 
tel dommage. Si votre pays n’autorise pas l’exclusion ou la limitation de responsabilité pour les 
dommages indirects, accessoires ou de quelque nature que ce soit, il se peut que la limitation ou 
l’exclusion ci-dessus ne s’appliquera pas à votre égard.**
