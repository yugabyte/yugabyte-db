**Purpose:** Convert a homogeneous JSON _array_ of JSON _objects_ into the equivalent set of SQL _records_.

**Signature** For the `jsonb` variant:

```
input value:       jsonb
return value:      SETOF record
```

**Notes:** The function `jsonb_to_recordset()` bears the same relationship to [`jsonb_to_record()`](../jsonb-to-record) as [`jsonb_populate_recordset()`](../jsonb-populate-recordset) bears to [`jsonb_populate_record()`](../jsonb-populate-record).

Therefore, the `DO` block that demonstrated the functionality of [`jsonb_populate_recordset()`](../jsonb-populate-recordset/) can be extended to demonstrate the functionality of `jsonb_to_recordset()` as well and to show that their results are identical. See the _"Record and array comparison"_ note in the account of `jsonb_populate_recordset()`.

```plpgsql
create type t as (a int, b int);

do $body$
declare
  array_of_objects constant jsonb :=
    '[
      {"a": 1, "b": 2},
      {"b": 4, "a": 3},
      {"a": 5, "c": 6},
      {"b": 7, "d": 8},
      {"c": 9, "d": 0}
    ]';

  rows_1 t[];
  rows_2 t[];
  expected_rows constant t[] :=
    array[
      (   1,    2)::t,
      (   3,    4)::t,
      (   5, null)::t,
      (null,    7)::t,
      (null, null)::t
    ];
  row t;
  n int := 0;
begin
  for row in (
    select a, b
    from jsonb_populate_recordset(null::t, array_of_objects)
    )
  loop
    n := n + 1;
    rows_1[n] := row;
  end loop;

  n := 0;
  for row in (
    select a, b
    from jsonb_to_recordset(array_of_objects)
    as on_the_fly(a int, b int)
    )
  loop
    n := n + 1;
    rows_2[n] := row;
  end loop;

  assert
    (rows_1 = expected_rows) and
    (rows_2 = expected_rows),
  'unexpected';
end;
$body$;
```

The same considerations apply here as do for [`to jsonb_to_record()`](../jsonb-to-record) if the target `record` data type has a non-primitive field. The `jsonb_to_recordset()` syntax variant therefore has no practical advantage over the [`jsonb_populate_recordset()`](../jsonb-populate-recordset) variant.
