## Synopsis

Use the `EXECUTE` statement to execute a previously prepared statement. This separation is a performance optimization because a prepared statement would be executed many times with different values while the syntax and semantics analysis and rewriting are done only once during `PREPARE` processing.

## Syntax

{{%ebnf%}}
  execute_statement
{{%/ebnf%}}

## Semantics

### *name*

Specify the name of the prepared statement to execute.

### *expression*

Specify the expression. Each expression in `EXECUTE` must match with the corresponding data type from `PREPARE`.

## Examples

- Create a sample table.

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# CREATE TABLE sample(k1 int, k2 int, v1 int, v2 text, PRIMARY KEY (k1, k2));
```

- Prepare a simple insert.

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# PREPARE ins (bigint, double precision, int, text) AS
               INSERT INTO sample(k1, k2, v1, v2) VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4);
```

- Execute the insert twice (with different parameters).

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# EXECUTE ins(1, 2.0, 3, 'a');
```

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# EXECUTE ins(2, 3.0, 4, 'b');
```

- Check the results.

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# SELECT * FROM sample ORDER BY k1;
```

```
 k1 | k2 | v1 | v2
----+----+----+----
  1 |  2 |  3 | a
  2 |  3 |  4 | b
(2 rows)
```
