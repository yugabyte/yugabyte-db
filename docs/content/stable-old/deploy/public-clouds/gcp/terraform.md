## Prerequisites

Download and install [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

Verify the installation using the `terraform` command.

```sh
$ terraform
```

You should see output similar to the following.

```output
Usage: terraform [--version] [--help] <command> [args]
...
Common commands:
    apply              Builds or changes infrastructure
    console            Interactive console for Terraform interpolations
    destroy            Destroy Terraform-managed infrastructure
    env                Workspace management
    fmt                Rewrites config files to canonical format
```

## Create a terraform configuration file

1. Create a terraform file with provider details.

    ```terraform
    provider "google"
    {
      # Provide your Creadentilals
      credentials = "${file("yugabyte-pcf-bc8114281026.json")}"

      # The name of your GCP project
      project = "<Your-GCP-Project-Name>"
    }
    ```

    To obtain your credentials file, refer to [Getting started with authentication](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started) in the GCP documentation.

1. Add the Yugabyte Terraform module to your file.

    ```terraform
    module "yugabyte-db-cluster"
    {
      source = "github.com/Yugabyte/terraform-gcp-yugabyte.git"

      # The name of the cluster to be created.
      cluster_name = "test-cluster"

      # key pair.
      ssh_private_key = "SSH_PRIVATE_KEY_HERE"
      ssh_public_key = "SSH_PUBLIC_KEY_HERE"
      ssh_user = "SSH_USER_NAME_HERE"

      # The region name where the nodes should be spawned.
      region_name = "YOUR_VPC_REGION"

      # Replication factor.
      replication_factor = "3"

      # The number of nodes in the cluster, this cannot be lower than the replication factor.
      node_count = "3"
    }
    ```

## Create a cluster

Init terraform first if you haven't already done so.

```sh
$ terraform init
```

To check what changes are going to happen in your environment, run the following:

```sh
$ terraform plan
```

Run the following to create the instances and bring up the cluster:

```sh
$ terraform apply
```

After the cluster is created, go to the URL `http://<node ip or dns name>:7000` to view the UI. You can find the node's IP or DNS by running the following:

```sh
$ terraform state show google_compute_instance.yugabyte_node[0]
```

You can check the state of the nodes at any point by running the following command:

```sh
$ terraform show
```

## Verify resources created

The following resources are created by this module:

- `module.terraform-gcp-yugabyte.google_compute_instance.yugabyte_node`

    The GCP VM instances.

    For a cluster named `test-cluster`, the instances are named `yugabyte-test-cluster-n1`, `yugabyte-test-cluster-n2`, and `yugabyte-test-cluster-n3`.

- `module.terraform-gcp-yugabyte.google_compute_firewall.Yugabyte-Firewall`

    The firewall rule that allows various clients to access the YugabyteDB cluster.

    For a cluster named `test-cluster`, this firewall rule is named `default-yugabyte-test-cluster-firewall` with the ports 7000, 9000, 9042, and 6379 open to all.

- `module.terraform-gcp-yugabyte.google_compute_firewall.Yugabyte-Intra-Firewall`

    The firewall rule that allows communication internal to the cluster.

    For a cluster named `test-cluster`, this firewall rule is named `default-yugabyte-test-cluster-intra-firewall` with the ports 7100 and 9100 open to all other VM instances in the same network.

- `module.terraform-gcp-yugabyte.null_resource.create_yugabyte_universe`

    A local script that configures the newly created instances to form a new YugabyteDB universe.

## Destroy the cluster (optional)

To destroy what you just created, run the following command:

```sh
$ terraform destroy
```
