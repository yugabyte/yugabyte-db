Monitor performance metrics for your universe to ensure the universe configuration matches its performance requirements using the universe **Metrics** page.

The **Metrics** page displays graphs representing information on operations, latency, and other parameters accumulated over time. By examining specific metrics, you can diagnose and troubleshoot issues.

You access metrics by navigating to **Universes > Universe-Name > Metrics**, as shown in the following illustration:

![Metrics Page](/images/yp/metrics_main.png)

Use the time menu to change the range. To zoom in to view granular data points, select a portion of the time range along the y-axis of any chart. This zooms all charts.

![Fine grained metrics](/images/yp/fine-grain-metrics.png)

Click the refresh button to restore the default time range.

You can create custom PromQL queries and run them against any graph. To do this, from the **Metrics** page, click the Prometheus icon at the top right corner of any metrics graph to display the Prometheus window, then paste your query in the Prometheus query editor.

For example, to view the per-table p99 latency metrics, you can run the following PromQL query which uses the `ql_read_latency_sum` and `ql_read_latency_count` functions as follows:

```sql
label_replace(
   quantile_over_time(0.99, ((sum(rate(ql_read_latency_sum{node_prefix="<universe_name>", export_type="tserver_export", namespace_name!="system_platform"}[36s])) by (table_name))
   /
   (sum(rate(ql_read_latency_count{node_prefix="<universe_name>", export_type="tserver_export", namespace_name!="system_platform"}[36s])) by (table_name)))[30s:])
   , "quantile", "99", "table_name", "(.+)"
)
```

For more information, refer to [Querying Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/querying/basics/) in the Prometheus documentation.

## Filter metrics

You can display metrics based on different criteria:

- If your universe has more than one region, cluster, zone, or node, the **Metrics** page allows you to view metrics for a specific region, cluster, zone, or node.

- You can view the overall node metrics which represent an aggregate across the selected nodes. Depending on the metric type, either an average across nodes or a sum of all node values is displayed.

- You can view metrics for up to five top or bottom outlier nodes. For example, to display graphs for the top three nodes with the highest CPU usage, you would select **Outlier Nodes**, then **Top**, and then **3 nodes**. The graph also includes the average for all nodes.

  Note that **Selected Node average** in the graph means the average of all the nodes that you have selected. For example, if you have filtered by region, then the selected node average would be average of all nodes in the selected region.

- You can view metrics for up to seven top or bottom outlier tables, including both system and user tables. For example, to display graphs for two tables with the highest read latency, you would select **Outlier Tables**, then **Top**, and then **2 tables**. The graph also includes the average for all tables.

  Note that the namespace name is appended with the table name and separated by a `.` (dot) operator.

- You can further restrict the outlier nodes or tables graphs to only display metrics for specific operations, events, statuses, and so on. For example, you can find out how many YSQL `SELECT` statements per second have been executed by the top-performing three nodes in the past six hours by selecting **Last 6 hr > Outlier Nodes > Top > 3 nodes > YSQL Ops > Total YSQL Ops / Sec > Select**.

## Monitor your universe

You should do the following on a regular basis:

- Monitor remote bootstrap for node failures. You can access this metric via **Tablet Server > Remote Bootstraps** and **Tablet Server > RPC Queue Size**.
- Monitor the NTP server to ensure that it is running. You can access this information via your computer's operating system.
- Monitor clock skew so you can see when the clock is off by more than 500 milliseconds. You can access this metric via **Node > Clock Skew**.
- Monitor your disk usage. The default is 80% used, but you should consider this metric in the context of your environment. For example, the usage percentage can be higher on larger disks; some file systems issue an alert at 75% usage due to performance degradation. You can access this metric via your computer's operating system.
- Monitor YSQL and YCQL operations latency and tune it according to your application service level agreement. You can access this metric via **YSQL Ops and Latency**, **YCQL Ops and Latency**, **YSQL Advanced**, and **YCQL Advanced**.
- Monitor average read and write latency so you know when latency starts to degrade, at which point you should tune it according to averages. You can access this metric via **Tablet Server > Average Latency**.
- Monitor reactor delays to measure bottleneck of incoming requests. You can access this metric via **Tablet Server > Reactor Delays**.
- Monitor log statistics per node to measure churn in the log cache size to determine high rate of evictions. You can access this metric via **Tablet Server > WAL Stats / Node**.
- Monitor the tablet and master servers' RPC queue size so you can see all the sub-elements and know if there is a bottleneck that might cause performance degradation. You can access this metric via **Tablet Server > RPC Queue Size** and **Master Server > RPC Queue Size**.
- Monitor DocDB cache miss ratio so you can tune the cache when necessary. You can access this metric via **DocDB > Cache Hit & Miss**.

## Universe metrics

The following tables describe metrics available via YugabyteDB Anywhere.

### YSQL ops and latency

| **Graph**              | **Description**                                              | **Alert Guidance**                                           | **Example**                       |
| :--------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Total YSQL Ops / Sec   | The count of DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, and UPDATE statements through the YSQL API. <br>This does not include index writes. | An alert should be issued if count drops significantly lower than your average count, as this might indicate an application connection failure. In addition, an alert should be issued if the count is much higher than your average count, as this could indicate a DDoS, security incident, and so on.<br>It is recommended to coordinate this with the application team because there could be legitimate reasons for dips and spikes. | ![Total YSQL Ops / Sec](/images/yp/metrics1.png)   |
| YSQL Op Latency (Avg)  | Average time of DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, and UPDATE statements through the YSQL API. | An alert should be issued when the overall latency is close to or higher than your application SLA.<br>Note that the overall latency metric is less helpful for troubleshooting specific queries. It is recommended that the application track query latency.<br>Also note that there could be reasons your traffic experiences spikes in latency. For example, ad-hoc queries such as count(*) are executed. | ![YSQL Op Latency (Avg)](/images/yp/metrics2.png)   |
| Total YSQL Connections | Cumulative number of connections to YSQL backend for all nodes. This includes various  background connections, such as checkpointer, as opposed to an active connections count that only includes the client backend connections. | By default, each YB-TServer node allows up to 300 connections. You should consider issuing an alert when the total connection count is close to 300*(number of YB-TServers). | ![Total YSQL Connections](/images/yp/metrics100.png) |

### YCQL ops and latency

| **Graph**             | **Description**                                              | **Alert Guidance**                                           | **Example**                     |
| :-------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- |
| Total YCQL Ops / Sec  | The count of DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, and UPDATE transactions, as well as other statements through the YCQL API. | An alert should be issued if count drops significantly lower than your average count, as this could indicate an application connection failure. | ![Total YCQL Ops / Sec](/images/yp/metrics3.png) |
| YCQL Op Latency (Avg) | The average time of DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, and UPDATE transactions, as well as other statements through the YCQL API. | An alert should be issued when latency is close to or higher than your application SLA. | ![YCQL Op Latency](/images/yp/metrics4.png) |
| YCQL Op Latency (P99) | The average time of the top 99% of DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, and UPDATE transactions, as well as other statements through the YCQL API. | If this value is significantly higher than expected, then it might be a cause for concern and you might want to issue an alert.<br>You should check whether or not there are consistent spikes in latency. | ![YCQL Op Latency P99](/images/yp/metrics5.png) |

### Resource

Resource metrics should be considered on a per-node basis.

| Graph                                 | **Description**                                              | **Alert Guidance**                                           | **Example**                      |
| :------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| CPU Usage                             | The percentage of CPU utilization on nodes being consumed by the tablet or master server Yugabyte processes, as well as other processes, if any.<br>In general, CPU usage is a measure of all processes running on the server.<br><br>The user CPU time is the amount of time the processor worked on all the processes.<br><br>The system CPU time is the amount of time the processor worked on the operating system's functions connected to the processes. | If you have alerts enabled, you should check  if you received any high CPU utilization alerts. These alerts could indicate a problem and may require debugging by Yugabyte Support. | ![CPU Usage](/images/yp/metrics6.png)  |
| Memory Usage (Buffered, Cached, Free) | The amount of RAM (in GB) available to the nodes in the cluster.<br><br>The buffered memory is the size of in-memory block input/output buffers.<br><br>The cached memory is the size of the page cache.<br><br>Free memory is not in use. | An alert should not be issued on memory metrics directly. It is recommended to use another metric to troubleshoot the underlying problem causing any memory bottlenecks.<br>The assumption is that the computer is dedicated to Yugabyte processes, therefore Yugabyte processes aggressively use the memory provided for caches and other operations. | ![Memory Usage](/images/yp/metrics7.png)  |
| Disk IOPS / Node                      | The number of disk input / output read and write operations per second averaged over each node. | Large spikes usually indicate large compactions. Rarely, in cases of a spiky workload, this could indicate block cache misses.<br>Because random reads always hit disk, it is recommended to increase IOPS capacity for this type of workload.<br>You should set an alert to a value much greater than your average or as a percentage of your available IOPS.<br>This value is averaged across all nodes in a cluster. An alert should be issued per node to detect source of underlying issues. | ![Disk IOPS / Node](/images/yp/metrics8.png)  |
| Disk Bytes / Sec / Node               | The number of bytes (scale: millions) being read or written to disk per second, averaged over each node. | If the maximum IOPS for the instance volume type has high utilization, you should ensure that the schema and query are optimized.<br>In addition, consider increasing the instance volume IOPS capacity. | ![Disk Bytes / Sec / Node](/images/yp/metrics9.png)  |
| Network Packets / Sec / Node          | The count of network packets received to the server (RX) and transmitted from the server (TX) per second, averaged over nodes. | Provides a view of the intensity of the network activity on the server.<br>This metric is informational and should not be subject to alerting. You may consider this information while examining alerts on other metrics. | ![Network Packets / Sec / Node](/images/yp/metrics10.png) |
| Network Bytes / Sec / Node            | The size (in bytes; scale: millions) of network packets received (RX) and transmitted (TX) per second, averaged over nodes. | Provides a view of the intensity of the network activity on the server.<br/>This metric is informational and should not be subject to alerting. You may consider this information while examining alerts on other metrics. | ![Network Bytes / Sec / Node](/images/yp/metrics11.png) |
| Network Errors / Sec / Node           | The number of errors related to network packets received (RX) and transmitted (TX) per second, averaged over nodes. | Generally, you should issue an alert for any error. If your environment produces a lot of errors, that could indicate an underlying infrastructure or operating system issue. | ![Network Errors / Sec / Node](/images/yp/metrics12.png) |
| System Load Over Time                 | The measure of system load averaged over 1, 5, and 15 minutes. | Values greater than your configured number of cores indicates that processes are waiting for CPU time. It is recommended that you consider your averages when determining the alert threshold.<br>In some cases, this can mean issuing an alert when the 5-minute load average is at 75-80% of available cores on the server. For some systems and workloads, you may want to set the threshold higher (for example, to 4 times the number of cores). | ![System Load Over Time](/images/yp/metrics13.png) |
| Clock Skew                            | For YugabyteDB to preserve data consistency, the clock drift and clock skew across different nodes are configured within bounds. | Clock skew is important for performance and data consistency. An OSS product can refuse to come up or can crash at a default value of 500 milliseconds, as it is considered better to be down than inconsistent.<br>YugabyteDB Anywhere issues alerts at the same threshold, and it should be considered a top priority to resolve this alert. | ![Clock Skew](/images/yp/metrics14.png) |

### YSQL advanced

| **Graph**             | **Description**                                              | **Alert Guidance**                                           | **Example**                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Total YSQL Ops / sec  | The number of various transaction control operations, such as BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK, as well as other operations through the YSQL API. | This metric is informational and should not be subject to alerting. You may consider this information while examining alerts on other metrics. | ![Total YSQL Ops / sec](/images/yp/metrics101.png) |
| YSQL Op Latency (Avg) | The average time taken by various transaction control operations, such as BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK, as well as other operations through the YSQL API. | This metric is informational and should not be subject to alerting. You may consider this information while examining alerts on other metrics. | ![YSQL Op Latency (Avg)](/images/yp/metrics102.png) |

### YCQL advanced

| **Graph**                     | **Description**                                              | **Alert Guidance**                                           | **Example**                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| YCQL Latency Breakdown        | The average time spent by the CQL API parsing and executing operations. | This metric is informational and should not be subject to alerting. You may consider this information while examining alerts on other metrics. | ![YCQL Latency](/images/yp/metrics15.png) |
| YBClient Ops Local vs Remote  | The count of local and remote read and write requests.<br>Local requests are executed on the same node that has received the request.<br>Remote requests are re-routed internally to a different node for executing the operation. | If an application is using a Yugabyte driver that supports local query routing optimization and prepared statements, the expected value for this is close to 100% local for local reads and writes.<br>If using the Cassandra driver or not using prepared statements, expect to see a relatively even split (for example, ~33% local and ~66% remote for a 3-node cluster). | ![YBClient Ops](/images/yp/metrics16.png) |
| YBClient Latency              | Latency of local and remote read and write requests.<br>Refer to the YBClient Ops Local vs Remote description regarding local and remote requests. | This metric is informational and should not be subject to alerting. You may consider this information while examining alerts on other metrics. | ![YBClient Latency](/images/yp/metrics17.png) |
| Reactor Delays                | The number of microseconds the incoming CQL requests spend in the worker queue before the beginning of processing. <br><br>Note that Reactor is a software implementation of a ring queue. | This value should be close to zero. If it is increasing or stays high, you should treat it as an indicator of a network issue or that the queues are full. If this is the case, you should investigate throughput and queue size and latency metrics for tuning guidance. | ![Reactor Delays](/images/yp/metrics18.png) |
| RPC Queue Size                | The number of RPCs in the service queue.                     | The queue size is an indicator of incoming traffic and throughput. Typically, it either shows very low values, which means that YugabyteDB is processing requests at a healthy rate; or a flat line at the maximum-configured queue size, which means that YugabyteDB has filled the queues and cannot process fast enough. | ![RPC Queue Size](/images/yp/metrics19.png) |
| Response Size (bytes)         | The size of the RPC response.                                | The response size for RPCs should be relatively small.<br>This metric is informational and should not be subject to alerting. You may consider this information while examining alerts on other metrics. | ![Response Size](/images/yp/metrics20.png) |
| Transactions                   | The number of transactions.                                  | This value depends on the application or activity. Because transactions can have batched statements, it's not possible to provide a specific guidance for this metric. You may consider this information while examining alerts on other metrics. | ![Transaction](/images/yp/metrics21.png) |
| Inbound RPC Connections Alive | The count of current connections at the CQL API level.       | If this spikes to a number much higher than your average, you should consider that there may be an active DDoS or a security incident. | ![Inbound RPC](/images/yp/metrics22.png) |

### Tablet server

| **Graph**                     | **Description**                                              | **Alert Guidance**                                           | **Example**                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Ops / Sec / Node                     | This is the key throughput measure.<br><br>Read: the count of read operations at the tablet level.<br>Write: the count of write operations at the tablet level. | This metric is informational and should not be subject to alerting. You may consider this information while examining alerts on other metrics. | ![Ops / Sec / Node](/images/yp/metrics23.png)                             |
| Average Latency                      | Read: the average latency of read operations at the tablet level.<br>Write: the average latency of write operations at the tablet level. | This metric is informational and should not be subject to alerting. You may consider this information while examining alerts on other metrics. | ![Average Latency](/images/yp/metrics24.png) |
| Reactor Delays                       | The number of microseconds the incoming RPC requests spend in the worker queue before the beginning of processing.<br><br>Note that Reactor is a software implementation of a ring queue. | If this metric spikes or remains at a high level, it indicates a network issue or that the queues are full. | ![Reactor Delays](/images/yp/metrics25.png) |
| Threads Running                      | The current number of running threads. | This metric is informational and should not be subject to alerting. You may consider this information while examining alerts on other metrics. | ![Threads Running](/images/yp/metrics103.png) |
| Threads Started | The total number of threads started on this server. | This metric is informational and should not be subject to alerting. You may consider this information while examining alerts on other metrics. | ![Threads Started](/images/yp/metrics104.png) |
| Consensus Ops / Sec                  | Yugabyte implements the RAFT consensus protocol, with minor modifications.<br><br><br>Update: replicas implement an RPC method called `UpdateConsensus` which allows a leader to replicate a batch of log entries to the follower. Only a leader may call this RPC method, and a follower can only accept an `UpdateConsensus` call with a term equal to or higher than its `currentTerm`.<br>Request: replicas also implement an RPC method called RequestConsensusVote, which is invoked by candidates to gather votes.<br>MultiRaftUpdates: information pending. | A high number for the Request Consensus indicates that a lot of replicas are looking for a new election because they have not received a heartbeat from the leader.<br>A high CPU or a network partition can cause this condition, and therefore it should result in issuing an alert. | ![Consensus Ops / Sec](/images/yp/metrics27.png) |
| Total Consensus Change Config        | This metric is related to the RAFT Consensus Process.<br><br>ChangeConfig: the number of times a peer was added or removed from the consensus group.<br>LeaderStepDown: the number of leader changes.<br>LeaderElectionLost:<br/>the number of times a leader election has failed.<br>RunLeaderElection: the count of leader elections due to a node failure or network partition. | You should issue an alert on LeaderElectionLost.<br>An increase in ChangeConfig typically happens when YugabyteDB Anywhere needs to move data around. This may happen as a result of a planned server addition or decommission, or a server crash looping.<br>A LeaderStepDown can indicate a normal change in leader, or it could be an indicator of a high CPU, blocked RPC queues, server restarts, and so on. You should issue an alert on LeaderStepDown as a proxy for other system issues. | ![Total Consensus Change Config](/images/yp/metrics28.png) |
| Remote Bootstraps                    | The total count of remote bootstraps.                        | When a RAFT peer fails, YugabyteDB executes an automatic remote bootstrap to create a new peer from the remaining ones.<br>Bootstrapping can also be a result of planned user activity when adding or decommissioning nodes.<br>It is recommended to issue an alert on a change in this count outside of planned activity. | ![Remote Bootstraps](/images/yp/metrics29.png) |
| Consensus RPC Latencies              | RequestConsensus: latency of consensus request operations.<br>UpdateConsensus: latency of consensus update operations.<br>MultiRaftUpdates: information pending. | If the value is high, it is likely that the overall latency is high.<br>This metric should be treated as a starting point in debugging the YB-Master and YB-TServer processes. | ![Consensus RPC Latencies](/images/yp/metrics30.png) |
| Change Config Latency                | Latency of consensus change configuration processes. | This metric is informational and should not be subject to alerting. You may consider this information while examining alerts on other metrics. | ![Change Config Latency](/images/yp/metrics31.png) |
| Context Switches                     | Voluntary context switches are writer processes that take a lock.<br>Involuntary context switches happen when a writer process has waited longer than a set threshold, which results in other waiting processes taking over. | A large number of involuntary context switches indicates a CPU-bound workload. | ![Context Switches](/images/yp/metrics32.png) |
| Spinlock Time / Server             | Spinlock is a measurement of processes waiting for a server resource and using a CPU to check and wait repeatedly until the resource is available. | This value can become very high on large computers with many cores.<br>The GFlag `tserver_tcmalloc_max_total_thread_cache_bytes` is by default 256 MB, and this is typically sufficient for 16-core computers with less than 32 GB of memory. For larger computers, it is recommended to increase this to 1 GB or 2 GB.<br>You should monitor memory usage, as this requires more memory. | ![Spinlock Time / Server](/images/yp/metrics34.png) |
| WAL Latency    | This is related to WALs.<br><br>Commit (Log Group Commit Latency): the number of microseconds spent on committing an entire group.<br>Append (Log Append Latency): the number of microseconds spent on appending to the log segment file.<br>Sync (Log Sync Latency): the number of microseconds spent on synchronizing the log segment file. | These metrics provide information on the amount to time spent writing to a disk. You should perform tuning accordingly. | ![WAL Latency](/images/yp/metrics35.png) |
| WAL Bytes Written / Sec / Node | The number of bytes written to the WAL after the tablet start. | This metric is informational and should not be subject to alerting. You may consider this information while examining alerts on other metrics. | ![WAL Bytes Written / Sec / Node](/images/yp/metrics36.png) |
| WAL Bytes Read / Sec / Node    | The number of bytes read from the WAL after the tablet start. | It is recommended to issue an alert on values higher than the normal range. An increase indicates that followers are falling behind and are constantly trying to catch up.<br>In an xCluster replication topology, this can indicate replication latency. | ![WAL Bytes Read / Sec / Node](/images/yp/metrics37.png) |
| WAL Ops / Sec / Node   | This is related to WALs.<br><br>Commit (Log Group Commit Count): the number of commits of an entire group, per second, per node.<br>Append (Log Append Count): the number of appends to the log segment file, per second, per node.<br>Sync (Log Sync Count): the number of syncs for the log segment file, per second, per node. | This metric is informational and should not be subject to alerting. You may consider this information while examining alerts on other metrics. | ![WAL Ops / Sec / Node](/images/yp/metrics38.png) |
| TCMalloc Stats               | In Use (Heap Memory Usage): the number of bytes used by the application. Typically, this does not match the memory use reported by the OS because it does not include TCMalloc overhead or memory fragmentation.<br>Total (Reserved Heap Memory): the number of bytes of the system memory reserved by TCMalloc.<br> | This metric is informational and should not be subject to alerting. You may consider this information while examining alerts on other metrics.<br><br>Also consider the following:<br>Free Heap Memory: the number of bytes in free, mapped pages in a page heap. These bytes can be used to fulfill allocation requests. They always count towards virtual memory usage, and unless the underlying memory is swapped out by the OS, they also count towards physical memory usage.<br>Unmapped Heap Memory: the number of bytes in free, unmapped pages in a page heap. These are bytes that have been released back to the OS, possibly by one of the MallocExtension Release calls. They can be used to fulfill allocation requests, but typically incur a page fault. They always count towards virtual memory usage, and depending on the OS, usually do not count towards physical memory usage.<br>Thread Cache Memory Limit: a limit to the amount of memory that TCMalloc dedicates for small objects. In some cases, larger numbers trade off more memory use for improved efficiency.<br>Thread Cache Memory Usage: a measure of some of the memory TCMalloc is using (for small objects). | ![TCMalloc Stats](/images/yp/metrics39.png) |
| WAL Stats / Node               | WAL bytes read: the size (in bytes) of reads from the WAL after the tablet start.<br>WAL cache size: the total per-tablet size of consensus entries kept in memory. The log cache attempts to keep all entries which have not yet been replicated to all followers in memory, but if the total size of those entries exceeds the configured limit in an individual tablet, the oldest is evicted. | If the log cache size is greater than zero, the followers are behind.

## Command-line access to metrics

YugabyteDB Anywhere allows you to access all metrics via the command-line interface (CLI), including those not available from the **Metrics** page.

You can view YB-TServer and YB-Master server metrics in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and JSON formats in the browser or via the CLI using curl commands.

The following is the Prometheus command for the YB-TServer:

```sh
curl <node_IP>:9000/prometheus-metrics
```

Expect an output similar to the following:

![Prometheus](/images/yp/metrics-prometheus.png)

The following is the Prometheus command for the YB-Master:

```sh
curl <node_IP>:7000/prometheus-metrics
```

The following is the JSON command for the YB-TServer:

```sh
curl <node_IP>:9000/metrics
```

Expect an output similar to the following:

![JSON](/images/yp/metrics-json.png)

The following is the JSON command for the YB-Master:

```sh
curl <node_IP>:7000/metrics
```

You can obtain additional information if you request the schema in the metrics URL, as follows:

```sh
curl <node_IP>:9000/metrics?include_schema=true
```

```sh
curl <node_IP>:7000/metrics?include_schema=true
```

The output would be similar to the following:

```json

```

{{< note title="Note" >}}

YugabyteDB Anywhere obtains the replication lag using Prometheus metrics from the YB-TServer port 9000. If this port is closed, the xCluster replication still works, but the replication lag would not be available via **Metrics**.
