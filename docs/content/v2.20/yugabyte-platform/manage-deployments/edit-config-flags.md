Adding and modifying configuration flags for your YB-Master and YB-TServer nodes in a YugabyteDB universe allows you to resolve issues, improve performance, and customize functionality. If your universe includes a read replica cluster, you can also add or modify configuration flags for the YB-TServer nodes in the read replica cluster.

For more information about the available configuration flags, see the following:

- [YB-TServer configuration reference](../../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/)
- [YB-Master configuration reference](../../../reference/configuration/yb-master/)

## Modify configuration flags

You can add and edit configuration flags by navigating to the universe and clicking **Actions > Edit Flags** to open the **G-Flags** dialog shown in the following illustration:

![Modify configuration flags](/images/ee/edit-config-2.png)

To customize flags of the read replica of a universe that has a read replica cluster, deselect the **Apply the same Flags to primary cluster and Read Replica** option. (This option is only available for universes with a read replica.) This displays the **Read Replica** tab. [Add](#add-flags) and [modify](#edit-flags) flags as you would for the primary cluster. Note that read replicas only have YB-TServers.

Depending on the flag, the universe may need to be restarted to apply the changes. You can apply changes as follows:

- Immediately using a rolling restart.
- Immediately using a concurrent restart.
- Immediately apply any changes that do not require a restart and wait until the next time the universe is restarted to apply the remaining changes.

If any configuration flag value contains commas or single quotation marks, enclose that configuration flag/value pair in double quotation marks. For example, for the flag ysql_pg_conf_csv, the value could be formatted as the following:

```sh
"log_line_prefix='%m [%p %l %c] %q[%C %R %Z %H] [%r %a %u %d] '","log_connections='on'","log_disconnections='on'"
```

### Add flags

Click **Add Flags > Add to Master** to open the **Add to Master** dialog, then select the flag you want to add to YB-Master and set its value, as per the following illustration:

![Add flags to Master](/images/ee/add-master-1.png)

Click **Add Flags > Add to T-Server** to open the **Add to T-Server** dialog, then select the flag you want to add to YB-TServer and set its value.

Use **Add as JSON > Add to Master** and **Add as JSON > Add to T-Server** to import flags in bulk. The flags must be defined as key-value pairs in a JSON format via the in the **Add to T-Server** or **Add to Master** dialog, as per the following illustration:

![Add flags as JSON](/images/ee/add-gflags-json.png)

### Edit flags

To edit a flag:

1. Find the flag you want to change in the **FLAG NAME** column.

1. Click the **Edit Flag** icon for either **MASTER VALUE** or **T-SERVER VALUE** to open the **Edit Flag Value** dialog, as per the following illustration:

    ![Edit flag](/images/ee/master-flag-1.png)

1. Change the value in the **Flag Value** field and then click **Confirm**.

To delete the flag's value, click the **Remove Flag** icon for either **MASTER VALUE** or **T-SERVER VALUE** or both.

## Add configuration flags

You can add configuration flags when you are creating a new universe, as follows:

- Navigate to either **Dashboard** or **Universes** and click **Create Universe**.
- Complete the required sections of the **Create Universe** page.
- When you reach **G-Flags**, perform steps described in [Modify configuration flags](#modify-configuration-flags).
