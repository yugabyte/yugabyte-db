Using YugabyteDB Anywhere you can create a universe spanning multiple geographic regions.

For example, you can deploy a universe across Oregon (US-West), South Carolina (US-East), and Tokyo (Asia-Northeast).

## Prerequisites

Before you start creating a universe, ensure that you have created a provider configuration as described in [Create provider configurations](../../configure-yugabyte-platform/).

## Create a universe

To create a multi-region universe:

1. Navigate to **Dashboard** or **Universes**, and click **Create Universe**.

1. Enter the universe details. Refer to [Universe settings](../create-universe-multi-zone/#universe-settings).

    The settings are identical to deploying a multi-zone universe, except for the placement of nodes in multiple regions.

1. Select the regions in which to deploy nodes. The available regions will depend on the provider you selected.

1. Optionally, for **G-Flags**, click **Add Flags**, **Add to Master**, and add the following flags for Master:

    ```properties
    leader_failure_max_missed_heartbeat_periods 5
    raft_heartbeat_interval_ms 1500
    leader_lease_duration_ms 6000
    ```

    And add the following flags for T-Server:

    ```properties
    leader_failure_max_missed_heartbeat_periods 5
    raft_heartbeat_interval_ms 1500
    leader_lease_duration_ms 6000
    ```

    Because the data is globally replicated, RPC latencies are higher; you can use these flags to increase the failure detection interval in a higher RPC latency deployment.

1. Click **Create**.

## Examine the universe

When the universe is created, you can access it via **Universes** or **Dashboard**.

To see a list of nodes that belong to this universe, select **Nodes**. Notice that the nodes are distributed across geographic regions.

You can also verify that the instances were created in the appropriate regions by clicking on the node name to access the cloud provider's instances page. For GCP, you navigate to **Compute Engine > VM Instances** and search for instances that contain the name of your universe in their name.

## Run a global application

Before you can run a workload, you need to connect to each node of your universe and perform the following:

- Run the `CassandraKeyValue` workload.
- Write data with global consistency (higher latencies are expected).
- Read data from the local data center (low latency timeline consistent reads).

The first step is to navigate to **Nodes**, click **Connect**, and then use the **Connect** dialog to provide the required endpoints.

### Connect to the nodes

You start by creating three Bash terminals. Then, for each node, click its corresponding **Actions > Connect**, copy the sudo command displayed in the **Access your node** dialog, and paste it into a Bash terminal.

<!--

, as per the following illustration:

![Multi-region universe node terminals](/images/ee/multi-region-universe-node-shells.png)

-->

With the goal of starting a workload from each node, perform the following on every terminal:

1. Install Java by executing the following command:

    ```sh
    sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk.x86_64 -y
    ```

1. Switch to the `yugabyte` user by executing the following command:

    ```sh
    sudo su - yugabyte
    ```

1. Export the `YCQL_ENDPOINTS` environment variable (IP addresses for nodes in the cluster) by navigating to **Nodes**, clicking **Connect**, then using the **Connect** dialog to copy endpoints under the relevant category, and finally pasting this into a Shell variable on the database node `yb-dev-helloworld2-n1` to which you are connected, as per the following example:

    ```shell
    export YCQL_ENDPOINTS="10.138.0.3:9042,10.138.0.4:9042,10.138.0.5:9042"
    ```

### Run the workload

Run the following command on each of the nodes, substituting *REGION* with the region code for each node:

```sh
java -jar /home/yugabyte/tserver/java/yb-sample-apps.jar \
            --workload CassandraKeyValue \
            --nodes $YCQL_ENDPOINTS \
            --num_threads_write 1 \
            --num_threads_read 32 \
            --num_unique_keys 10000000 \
            --local_reads \
            --with_local_dc <REGION>
```

You can find the region code of each node by navigating to **Nodes** and looking under the **CLOUD INFO** column: the first part before the slash indicates the region. For example, `us-west1`.

## Check the performance

The application is expected to have the following characteristics based on its deployment configuration:

- Global consistency on writes, which would cause higher latencies in order to replicate data across multiple geographic regions.
- Low latency reads from the nearest data center, which offers timeline consistency (similar to asynchronous replication).

You can verify this by navigating to **Metrics** and checking the overall performance of the application.
