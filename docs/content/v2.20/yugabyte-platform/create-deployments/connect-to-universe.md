Connect to your YugabyteDB database from your desktop using the YugabyteDB [ysqlsh](../../../admin/ysqlsh/) and [ycqlsh](../../../admin/ycqlsh) client shells. Because YugabyteDB is compatible with PostgreSQL and Cassandra, you can also use [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/app-psql.html) and third-party tools to connect.

You can connect to the database on a universe in the following ways:

- Use SSH to tunnel to one of the universe nodes, and run ysqlsh or ycqlsh on the node.
- Download and run the client shells from your desktop.

## Download the universe certificate

If the universe uses encryption in transit, to connect you need to first download the universe TLS root certificate. Do the following:

1. Navigate to **Configs > Security > Encryption in Transit**.

1. Find the certificate for your universe in the list and click **Actions** and download the certificate.

For more information on connecting to TLS-enabled universes, refer to [Connect to clusters](../../security/enable-encryption-in-transit/#connect-to-clusters).

## Connect to a universe node

The YugabyteDB shells are installed in the tserver/bin directory on each YB-TServer of a YugabyteDB universe.

### Access your YugabyteDB Anywhere instance

To connect to a universe node, you first need to be signed on to the machine where YugabyteDB Anywhere is installed, or connected via SSH.

To SSH to a YugabyteDB Anywhere instance hosted on the cloud provider, you enter the following:

```sh
ssh -i <path_to_secret> username@<platform_machine_external_ip>
```

For example, for an AWS instance, you can SSH using a command similar to the following:

```sh
ssh -i ~/.yugabyte/yb-dev-aws-2.pem ec2-user@my.yugabyte.aws
```

If your instance is on Kubernetes, use kubectl commands to connect. For example:

```sh
gcloud container clusters get-credentials --region us-west1 itest-release --project yugabyte
kubectl exec -it yw-ns-kvik-id7973-20230213-031611-yugaware-0 -n yw-ns-kvik-id7973-20230213-031611 -c yugaware -- bash
```

### Connect to a node

To run a shell from a universe node, do the following:

1. In YugabyteDB Anywhere, navigate to your universe and select the **Nodes** tab.

    ![Multi-zone universe nodes](/images/yp/multi-zone-universe-nodes-1.png)

1. Determine the node to which you wish to connect and click **Actions > Connect**.

1. Copy the SSH command displayed in the **Access your node** dialog shown in the following illustration:

    ![Multi-zone universe connect](/images/yp/multi-zone-universe-connect-2.png)

1. From the machine where YugabyteDB Anywhere is installed, run the command you copied. For example:

    ```sh.output
    sudo ssh -i /opt/yugabyte/yugaware/data/keys/f000ad00-aafe-4a67-bd1f-34bdaf3bee00/yb-dev-yugabyte-google-provider_f033ad00-aafe-4a00-bd1f-34bdaf3bee00-key.pem -ostricthostkeychecking=no -p 22 yugabyte@<node_ip_address>

    Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
    [ec2-user@yb-dev-helloworld1-n1 ~]$
    ```

1. On the node, navigate to the tserver/bin directory:

    ```sh
    cd /home/yugabyte/tserver/bin
    ```

1. Run ysqlsh or ycqlsh as follows:

    ```sh
    ./ysqlsh -h <node_ip_address>
    ```

    ```sh
    ./ycqlsh <node_ip_address>
    ```

## Connect from your desktop

### Prerequisites

- If you are using a Yugabyte client shell, ensure you are running the latest versions of the shells (Yugabyte Client 2.6 or later).

    You can download using the following command on Linux or macOS:

    ```sh
    $ curl -sSL https://downloads.yugabyte.com/get_clients.sh | bash
    ```

    Windows client shells require Docker. For example:

    ```sh
    docker run -it yugabytedb/yugabyte-client ysqlsh -h <hostname> -p <port>
    ```

- If your universe has TLS/SSL (encryption in-transit) enabled, you need to [download the certificate](#download-the-universe-certificate) to your computer.

- The host address of an endpoint on your universe.

    To view your universe endpoints, navigate to your universe and click **Connect**.

### Connect using a client shell

Use the ysqlsh, ycqlsh, and psql shells to connect to and interact with YugabyteDB using the YSQL and YCQL APIs.

</ul>

<div class="tab-content">
  <div id="ysqlsh" class="tab-pane fade show active" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="ysqlsh-tab">

To connect using ysqlsh, use the following connection string:

```sh
./ysqlsh "host=<HOST_ADDRESS> \
user=<DB USER> \
dbname=yugabyte \
sslmode=verify-full \
sslrootcert=<ROOT_CERT_PATH>"
```

Replace the following:

- `<HOST_ADDRESS>` with the IP address of an endpoint on your universe.
- `<DB USER>` with your database username.
- `yugabyte` with the database name, if you're connecting to a database other than the default (yugabyte).
- `<ROOT_CERT_PATH>` with the path to the root certificate on your computer.

To load sample data and explore an example using ysqlsh, follow the instructions in [Install the Retail Analytics sample database](../../../sample-data/retail-analytics/#install-the-retail-analytics-sample-database).

  </div>

  <div id="ycqlsh" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="ycqlsh-tab">

To connect using ycqlsh, use the following connection string:

```sh
SSL_CERTFILE=<ROOT_CERT_PATH> \
./ycqlsh \
<HOST_ADDRESS> 9042 \
-u <DB USER> \
--ssl
```

Replace the following:

- `<HOST_ADDRESS>` with the IP address of an endpoint on your universe.
- `<DB USER>` with your database username.
- `<ROOT_CERT_PATH>` with the path to the root certificate on your computer.

  </div>

  <div id="psql" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="psql-tab">

To connect using [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/app-psql.html), use the following connection string:

```sh
./psql --host=<HOST_ADDRESS> --port=5433 \
--username=<DB USER> \
--dbname=yugabyte \
--set=sslmode=verify-full \
--set=sslrootcert=<ROOT_CERT_PATH>
```

Replace the following:

- `<HOST_ADDRESS>` with the IP address of an endpoint on your universe.
- `<DB USER>` with your database username.
- `yugabyte` with the database name, if you're connecting to a database other than the default (yugabyte).
- `<ROOT_CERT_PATH>` with the path to the root certificate on your computer.

  </div>

</div>

### Connect using third party clients

Because YugabyteDB is compatible with PostgreSQL and Cassandra, you can use third-party clients to connect to your YugabyteDB clusters in YugabyteDB Aeon.

To connect, follow the client's configuration steps for PostgreSQL or Cassandra, and use the following values:

- **host** address of an endpoint on your universe.
- **port** 5433 for YSQL, 9042 for YCQL.
- **database** name; the default YSQL database is yugabyte.
- **username** and **password** of a user with permissions for the database; the default user is admin.

Your client may also require the use of the [universe certificate](#download-the-universe-certificate).

For information on using popular third-party tools with YugabyteDB, see [GUI clients](/preview/integrations/tools/).

## Run workloads

YugabyteDB Anywhere includes a number of sample applications provided in Docker containers.

To run sample applications on your universe, do the following:

1. [Connect to a universe node](#connect-to-a-universe-node).

1. Navigate to your universe and click **Actions > Run Sample Apps** to open the **Run Sample Apps** dialog shown in the following illustration:

    ![Run sample apps](/images/yp/multi-zone-universe-sample-apps-1.png)

1. Run the suggested Docker command in your SSH session on the node.

<!--

You can run one of the key-value workloads against the YCQL API and the YEDIS API as follows:

- Install Java by executing the following command:

  ```sh
  sudo yum install java-1.8.0-openjdk.x86_64 -y
  ```

- Switch to the yugabyte user by executing the following command:

  ```sh
  sudo su - yugabyte
  ```

- Export the `YCQL_ENDPOINTS` environment variable, supplying the IP addresses for nodes in the cluster, as follows:

  - Navigate to the **Universes > Overview** tab and click **YCQL Endpoints** to open a new tab with a list of IP addresses, as shown in the following illustration:

    ![YCQL end points](/images/ee/multi-zone-universe-ycql-endpoints.png)

  - Click the **Export** icon for **YCQL Services** to trigger export into a shell variable on the database node **yb-dev-helloworld1-n1** to which you are connected. Remember to replace the following IP addresses with those displayed in the YugabyteDB Anywhere UI.

    ```sh
    export YCQL_ENDPOINTS="10.138.0.3:9042,10.138.0.4:9042,10.138.0.5:9042"
    ```

- Export the `YEDIS_ENDPOINTS` environment variable by repeating the preceding procedure and as per the following illustration and command:

  ![YCQL end points](/images/ee/multi-zone-universe-yedis-endpoints.png)

  ```sh
  export YEDIS_ENDPOINTS="10.138.0.3:6379,10.138.0.4:6379,10.138.0.5:6379"
  ```

### CassandraKeyValue workload

To start the CassandraKeyValue workload, execute the following command:

```sh
java -jar /home/yugabyte/tserver/java/yb-sample-apps.jar \
            --workload CassandraKeyValue \
            --nodes $YCQL_ENDPOINTS \
            --num_threads_write 2 \
            --num_threads_read 32 \
            --value_size 128 \
            --num_unique_keys 10000000 \
            --nouuid
```

The sample application produces output similar to the following and reports some statistics in the steady state:

```output
Created table: [CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS CassandraKeyValue (k varchar, v blob, primary key (k));]
...
Read: 47388.10 ops/sec (0.67 ms/op), 816030 total ops  | Write: 1307.80 ops/sec (1.53 ms/op), 22900 total ops
Read: 47419.99 ops/sec (0.67 ms/op), 1053156 total ops | Write: 1303.85 ops/sec (1.53 ms/op), 29420 total ops
Read: 47220.98 ops/sec (0.68 ms/op), 1289285 total ops | Write: 1311.67 ops/sec (1.52 ms/op), 35979 total ops
```

-->

The **Metrics** tab of the universe allows you to see the metrics graphs, where server-side metrics tally with the client-side metrics reported by the load tester.

<!--

![YCQL Load Metrics](/images/ee/multi-zone-universe-ycql-load-metrics.png)

-->

You can also view metrics at a per-node level.

<!--

![YCQL Load Metrics Per Node](/images/ee/multi-zone-universe-ycql-load-metrics-per-node.png)

-->

You can stop the load tester as follows:

- Find the container by executing the following command:

  ```shell
  user@yugaware-1:~$ sudo docker container ls | grep "yugabytedb/yb-sample-apps"
  ```

  Expect an output similar to the following:

  ```output
  <container_id> yugabytedb/yb-sample-apps "/usr/bin/java -jar …" 17 seconds ago Up 16 seconds                                                                                                            jovial_morse
  ```

  For example, if the container ID is ac144a49d57d, you would see the following output:

  ```output
  ac144a49d57d yugabytedb/yb-sample-apps "/usr/bin/java -jar …" 17 seconds ago Up 16 seconds                                                                                                            jovial_morse
  ```

- Stop the container by executing the following command:

  ```shell
  user@yugaware-1:~$ sudo docker container stop <container_id>
  ```

  Expect the following output:

  ```output
  <container_id>
  ```

  For example, for a container with ID ac144a49d57d, you would need to execute the following command:

  ```shell
  user@yugaware-1:~$ sudo docker container stop ac144a49d57d
  ```

  You would see the following output:

  ```output
  ac144a49d57d
  ```

<!--

### RedisKeyValue workload

To start the RedisKeyValue workload, execute the following command.

```sh
$ java -jar /home/yugabyte/tserver/java/yb-sample-apps.jar \
            --workload RedisKeyValue \
            --nodes $YEDIS_ENDPOINTS \
            --num_threads_write 2 \
            --num_threads_read 32 \
            --value_size 128 \
            --num_unique_keys 10000000 \
            --nouuid
```

The sample application produces output similar to the following and reports some statistics in the steady state:

```output
Read: 50069.15 ops/sec (0.64 ms/op), 657550 total ops  | Write: 1470.87 ops/sec (1.36 ms/op), 18849 total ops
Read: 50209.09 ops/sec (0.64 ms/op), 908653 total ops  | Write: 1454.87 ops/sec (1.37 ms/op), 26125 total ops
Read: 50016.18 ops/sec (0.64 ms/op), 1158794 total ops | Write: 1463.26 ops/sec (1.37 ms/op), 33443 total ops
```

If you open the **Metrics** tab of the universe, you should see the metrics graphs, as shown in the following illustration:

![YEDIS Load Metrics Per Node](/images/ee/multi-zone-universe-yedis-load-metrics.png)

Note that these server-side metrics tally with the client-side metrics reported by the load tester.

You should stop the sample application.
