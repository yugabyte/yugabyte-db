Universes deployed using YugabyteDB Anywhere include following node [alerts](../../alerts-monitoring/alert/) by default:

- DB Instance Down. A node is unreachable or down.
- DB Node Restart. The operating system rebooted.
- DB Instance Restart. A YugabyteDB process restarted (outside of a universe update).

If you are notified of one of these alerts, you can take the following steps.

## DB Instance Down

This alert fires when Prometheus is unable to scrape a node for metrics for (by default) more than 15 minutes.

#### What to do

1. Check the universe **Nodes** tab **Status** column.

1. If the status is Unreachable, confirm whether the host is up and reachable via your cloud provider (for example, AWS EC2) or on-premises environment.

1. If the host is down, restart it from the cloud console or equivalent.

    If necessary, follow the steps in [Eliminate an unresponsive node](../../manage-deployments/remove-nodes/#eliminate-an-unresponsive-node) to replace the node.

1. If the host is running, check the status of the node_exporter process. Prometheus uses the node_exporter service to export metrics, and if the service is down, the node will appear unreachable.

    - Connect to the node and check the status of node_exporter by running the following command:

        ```sh
        ps -ef | grep node_exporter
        systemctl status node_exporter
        ```

    - Restart node_exporter if needed:

        ```sh
        sudo systemctl restart node_exporter
        ```

    - Confirm node_exporter access at `http://<node_ip>:9300`.

## DB Node Restart

This alert tracks OS-level restarts using the `node_boot_time` metric.

#### What to do

1. SSH into the host and check if the reboot was planned or due to an issue.

1. Check logs as follows:

    ```sh
    cat /var/log/messages | grep -i reboot
    ```

    For Ubuntu:

    ```sh
    journalctl --list-boots
    ```

1. Check for other causes, such as power loss, kernel panic, or scheduled reboots.

## DB Instance Restart

This alert fires when a YugabyteDB process (TServer or Master) restarts without a planned update.

#### What to do

1. SSH into the node and inspect the following logs:

    - YugabyteDB logs (`/home/yugabyte/tserver/logs/` or `/mnt/d0/yb-data/tserver/logs/`).
    - OS logs, for memory pressure or crash signals.

    Look for FATAL logs; the presence of a FATAL log file that corresponds with the time of the failure is a positive indicator for a crash and analyzing this log will likely point to the root cause.

1. Check whether a core dump or out of memory event occurred.

1. If a user or automation restarted the process, confirm the intent and whether alerts can be tuned.
