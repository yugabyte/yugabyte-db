{{< tip title="Download a zip of scripts that include all the code examples that implement this case study" >}}

All of the `.sql` scripts that this section presents for copy-and-paste at the `ysqlsh` prompt are included for download in a zip-file.

[Download `recursive-cte-code-examples.zip`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/master/sample/recursive-cte-code-examples/recursive-cte-code-examples.zip).

After unzipping it on a convenient new directory, you'll see a `README.txt`.  It tells you how to start the Bacon Numbers master-script. This invokes all the child scripts that: (1) ingest the `imdb.small.txt` data set from the Oberlin College Computer Science department's [CSCI 151 Lab 10—Everything is better with Bacon](https://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~rhoyle/16f-cs151/lab10/index.html); and (2) solve the Bacon Numbers problem using this data set. (The `imdb.small.txt` file is included in the `.zip`.) Simply start it in `ysqlsh`. You can run it time and again. It always finishes silently. You can see the report that it produces on a dedicated spool directory and confirm that your reports are identical to the reference copies that are delivered in the zip-file.

## Download and ingest some IMDb data

Before trying the code in this section, make sure that you have created the supporting infrastructure:

- The _"actors"_, _"movies_", and _"cast_members"_ tables for representing IMDb data—see [`cr-actors-movies-cast-members-tables.sql`](../../bacon-numbers#cr-actors-movies-cast-members-tables-sql)

- The _"edges"_ table and the procedure to populate it from the _"cast_members"_ table—see [`cr-actors-movies-edges-table-and-proc-sql`](../../bacon-numbers#cr-actors-movies-edges-table-and-proc-sql)

- All the code shown in the section [Common code for traversing all kinds of graph](../../traversing-general-graphs/common-code/). Be sure to chose the [cr-raw-paths-no-tracing.sql](../../traversing-general-graphs/common-code#cr-raw-paths-no-tracing-sql) option.

Use Internet search for "download IMDb data for Bacon Numbers". This brings you to useful subsets of the vast, entire, IMDb data set that have been prepared by, for example, university Computer Science departments specifically to support Bacon Numbers course assignments. The [Oberlin College Computer Science department](https://www.cs.oberlin.edu/) is a good source. Go to [CSCI 151 Lab 10—Everything is better with Bacon](https://www.cs.oberlin.edu/~rhoyle/16f-cs151/lab10/index.html) and look for this:

> "[imdb.small.txt](http://cs.oberlin.edu/~gr151/imdb/imdb.small.txt): a 1817 line file with just a handful of performers (161), fully connected"

Here are a few lines from the file:

```
...
Alec Guinness|Kind Hearts and Coronets (1949)
Alec Guinness|Ladykillers, The (1955)
Alec Guinness|Last Holiday (1950)
Alec Guinness|Lavender Hill Mob, The (1951)
Alec Guinness|Lawrence of Arabia (1962)
Alec Guinness|Little Dorrit (1988)
Alec Guinness|Lovesick (1983)
...
```

The information content is identical to what the _"cast_members"_ table was designed to represent. (See the [`cr-actors-movies-cast-members-tables.sql`](../../bacon-numbers#cr-actors-movies-cast-members-tables-sql) script.) This means that the `ysqlsh` meta-command `\COPY` can be used, straightforwardly, to ingest the downloaded data.

However, as this script creates it, the _"actors"_ and _"movies"_ tables must be populated first so that the foreign key constraints to these from the _"cast_members"_ table will be satisfied when it's populated. Use this script to do the steps in the proper order and display the resulting table counts:

##### `insert-imdb-data.sql`

```plpgsql
delete from edges;
delete from cast_members;
delete from actors;
delete from movies;

drop table if exists cast_members cascade;
create table cast_members(
  actor            text not null,
  movie            text not null,
  constraint imdb_facts_pk primary key(actor, movie));

\copy cast_members(actor, movie) from 'imdb.small.txt' with delimiter '|';

insert into actors select distinct actor from cast_members;
insert into movies select distinct movie from cast_members;

alter table cast_members
add constraint cast_members_fk1 foreign key (actor)
  references actors(actor)
  match full
  on delete cascade
  on update restrict;

alter table cast_members
add constraint cast_members_fk2 foreign key(movie)
  references movies(movie)
  match full
  on delete cascade
  on update restrict;

\t on
select 'count(*) from cast_members... '||to_char(count(*), '9,999') from cast_members;
select 'count(*) from actors......... '||to_char(count(*), '9,999') from actors;
select 'count(*) from movies......... '||to_char(count(*), '9,999') from movies;
\t off
```

This is the result:

```
 count(*) from cast_members...  1,817

 count(*) from actors.........    161

 count(*) from movies.........  1,586
```

## Populate the "edges" table and inspect the result

Populate the _"edges"_ table and inspect a sample of the results:

##### `do-insert-edges.sql`

```plpgsql
call insert_edges();

with v(actor) as (
  select node_1 from edges
  union
  select node_2 from edges)
select actor from v order by 1
limit 10;

select distinct unnest(movies) as movie
from edges
order by 1
limit 10;

select
  node_1,
  node_2,
  replace(translate(movies::text, '{"}', ''), ',', ' | ') as movies
from edges
where node_1 < node_2
order by 1, 2
limit 10;

select
  node_1,
  node_2,
  replace(translate(movies::text, '{"}', ''), ',', ' | ') as movies
from edges
where node_1 > node_2
order by 2, 1
limit 10;
```

Here are the results of all the queries:

## Find the paths

Invoke the implementation of "_find_paths()"_ that will be able to handle the real IMDd data that is shown at [`cr-find-paths-with-pruning.sql`](../../traversing-general-graphs/undirected-cyclic-graph/#cr-find-paths-with-pruning-sql). Invoke it _with_ early pruning:

```plpgsql
call find_paths('Kevin Bacon (I)', true);
```
Count the total number of paths that were found:

```plpgsql
\t on
select 'total number of pruned paths: '||count(*)::text from raw_paths;
\t off
```

This is the result.

```
total number of pruned paths: 160
```

You might like to use _"list_paths)"_ to list them all.

See what effect _"restrict_to_unq_containing_paths()"_ has:

```plpgsql
call restrict_to_unq_containing_paths('raw_paths', 'unq_containing_paths');
\t on
select 'total number of unique containing paths: '||count(*)::text from unq_containing_paths;
\t off
```
This is the result.

```
 total number of unique containing paths: 144
```
## Decorate the path edges with the list of movies that brought each edge

Ensure that you have created the _"decorated_paths_report()"_ table function using the [`cr-decorated-paths-report.sql`](../../bacon-numbers/#cr-decorated-paths-report-sql) script. Invoke it thus to list all five decorated shortest paths:

```plpgsql
\t on
select t from decorated_paths_report('raw_paths', 'Christopher Nolan');
\t off
```

This is the result:

```
