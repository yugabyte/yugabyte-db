Use the YugabyteDB Docs MCP Server to access official YugabyteDB documentation, including API and CLI references, blogs, and support articles, directly from your IDE or AI tool (including ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, and VS Code).

Once connected, you can get answers to questions about YugabyteDB without leaving your IDE.

## Setup

The MCP server is hosted at `https://yugabyte.mcp.kapa.ai`. Note that when you connect to the MCP server for the first time, you must authenticate via a Google sign-in window. For more information, see [Authentication](https://docs.kapa.ai/integrations/mcp/overview#authentication) in the Kapa documentation.

To add the Yugabyte Docs MCP server, do the following:

1. On any page of the YugabyteDB documentation site, click **Ask AI > Use MCP**.

    ![Use MCP](/images/ai/use-mcp.png)

1. Choose the option that best matches your tool. <br/><br/>

    {{< tabpane text=true >}}

{{% tab header="Cursor" lang="cursor" %}}

The **Add to Cursor** option opens Cursor to your **Cursor Settings**.

Perform the following additional steps:

1. Click **Install** under **Install MCP Server?**.
1. Click **Connect** beside the yugabyte-docs server and you should see a green dot with the tool enabled.
1. If you get a **Needs authentication** message, click the message and restart Cursor to apply the changes.

  {{% tab header="VS Code" lang="vscode" %}}

**Prerequisites**: VS Code 1.102 with GitHub Copilot enabled.

The **Add to VS Code** option opens VS Code directly with the MCP server configuration window.

Perform the following additional steps:

1. Click **Install** to install the yugabyte-docs MCP server.
1. Go to **Extensions** to verify that yugabyte-docs is listed as an installed MCP server.
1. Open the Chat view (Ctrl+Cmd+I / Ctrl+Alt+I), and select **Agent** mode from the dropdown.
1. Click the **Configure Tools** button to verify that yugabyte-docs is selected in the available MCP tools.

  {{% tab header="Claude Code" lang="claude" %}}

1. Use the following CLI command to register the Docs MCP server with the Claude Code agent.

    ```sh
    claude mcp add --transport http yugabyte-docs https://yugabyte.mcp.kapa.ai
    ```

1. Confirm the server is listed:

    ```bash
    claude mcp list
    ```

  {{% /tab %}}

  {{% tab header="MCP URL" lang="mcp-url" %}}

For Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, or other MCP-compatible clients, you can use the hosted endpoint or a local configuration.

**Option A — Kapa-hosted endpoint**

Use this URL in clients that accept an MCP server URL:

`https://yugabyte.mcp.kapa.ai`

**Option B — Local config (for example, Claude Desktop)**

**Prerequisite**: Node v18 or higher.

Add the server to your client config (for example, `claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "yugabyte-docs": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "mcp-remote",
        "https://yugabyte.mcp.kapa.ai"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Note that you must fully quit Claude Desktop (from the menu bar, not just closing the window) for changes to take effect.

### Troubleshooting Node.js issues

If the logs for the MCP server shows a SyntaxError, it is likely due to an outdated version of Node.js.

- Check your version: Run `node -v` in your terminal.

- Verify the path: If you use NVM, Claude might still pick up an older system version of Node. You can check which version is actually running by looking at the **Claude > Developer > View Logs** and searching for the "Using MCP server command" line.

## Examples

After the server is connected, you can ask questions about Yugabyte from your IDE or AI tool, such as the following:

- Explain the Raft consensus implementation in YugabyteDB.
- Give me a YSQL example of a stored procedure that handles a bank transfer with error checking.
- What is the recommended way to perform a rolling upgrade on a 6-node cluster?
- Summarize the main differences between YSQL and YCQL index types.

{{<note title="Important">}}
Responses from the LLM when using the MCP server (including summaries, generated SQL, and dashboards) are generated by AI and may not be fully accurate. Verify important results against your data or the [YugabyteDB documentation](/stable/).

### Example prompt in Claude Desktop

Sample prompt:

```text
What's new YugabyteDB Anywhere for v2025.1.1.1?
```

You should see a message from Claude indicating that it is searching YugabyteDB knowledge sources and a response similar to the following:

```output
I'll search the YugabyteDB documentation for information about what's new in YugabyteDB Anywhere version 2025.1.1.0.

  YugabyteDB Anywhere v2025.1.1.1 - October 3, 2025
  =================================================

  Build: 2025.1.1.1-b1

  HIGHLIGHTS
  ----------

  xCluster Disaster Recovery (DR) – Control-plane support for DDL replication (EA)
    • Adds YugabyteDB Anywhere support for Automatic transactional xCluster replication
    • Enables seamless replication of schema changes across clusters in a DR setup

  UI updates to automatically provision on-premises nodes (GA)
    • UI for creating on-premises providers has been modified to direct users to automatic provisioning
    • Improves the out-of-box experience

  NOTE: Support for legacy node provisioning will be dropped in v2025.2. Before upgrading to v2025.2, update your node provisioning workflows to support automatic provisioning.

  NEW FEATURES
  ------------
    • Backups with DDL (TP) - Backups succeed even when DDL changes are occurring during the backup process
    • Filter PII in support bundles (GA) - When collecting pgAudit logs in support bundles, sensitive PII data is now masked to reduce risk of data privacy violations
    • AWS EBS disk encryption support (EA) - Support for AWS's EBS disk encryption, complementing or offering an alternative to YugabyteDB's encryption-at-rest
    • Batching of rolling operations (GA) - During rolling restarts (software upgrades, flag changes), YugabyteDB Anywhere can now process multiple YB-TServer nodes simultaneously in each availability zone, reducing time by 2x-3x or more depending on batch size
```
