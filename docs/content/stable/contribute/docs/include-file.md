### readfile

This content is included from a separate file (called, in this case, `include-file.md`) using a `readfile` shortcode:

Use readfile to add repetitive text to multiple pages.

Headings in read files do _not_ appear in the right navigation.

However, shortcodes in the included file do render correctly:

{{<yb-version version="stable">}}

#### Another heading in the readfile

This heading does not appear in the right navigation.
