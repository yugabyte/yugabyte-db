For information on YSQL Connection Manager limitations, refer to [Limitations](../ycm-setup/#limitations).

## Connection exhaustion due to sticky connections

**Symptoms**

- Partially exhausted pool: Higher query execution latencies, reflected in higher `queued_logical_connections` and `avg_wait_time_ns` metrics.
- Completely exhausted server connection pool: Clients appear to hang or timeout while trying to authenticate or execute queries.

**Verify**

To offer complete correctness/range of support, Connection Manager makes connections for some features [sticky by default](../ycm-setup/#sticky-connections). You can verify this using the [sticky_connections metric](../ycm-monitor/#metrics). Use the `13000/connections` endpoint and search for `sticky_connections`.

Search for "sticky" in Connection Manager logs with `log_debug` enabled. See [Logging](../ycm-monitor/#logging).

Depending on your use case, you can enable flags or workarounds to avoid stickiness.

## Timeouts (connection exhaustion/high multiplexity factor)

**Symptoms**

For higher query execution latencies, timeouts may occur based on application layer handling.

**Verify**

Higher latencies will be reflected in the time taken for the client connection to attach to a server connection.

Look at `avg_wait_time_ns` on the `13000/connections` endpoint; higher values account for higher latencies.

If you have high multiplexity (many more client connections than server connections), clients may be waiting too long to attach to a server connection. Consider increasing the [ysql_max_connections setting](../ycm-setup/#configure).

## Unsupported authentication methods

- SCRAM. Salted Challenge Response Authentication Mechanism is not currently supported by Connection Manager. SCRAM is a secure method for user authentication where the client and server verify each other's identity without ever transmitting the actual password in plain text. This provides protection against password sniffing on an unreliable network. It's a challenge response mechanism, where the server sends a challenge and the client returns it a calculated value based on its password and salt. As part of the challenge response mechanism, Connection Manager does not throw any challenge to the client and so no response is received from the client.

- TCP IPv6 client connections. Connection Manager assumes all client connections use IPv4. If any IPv6 client connection tries to connect, Connection Manager will still authenticate against IPv4 in the host column of the hba file.

- CERT authentication. Connection Manager does not support CERT authentication (verify-full/verify-ca). CERT authentication requires connections to be SSL encrypted. Authentication with Connection Manager still happens on the database side. Therefore Connection Manager should forward all client credentials (for example, the password) along with setting up the SSL context on the database while doing authentication. The client connection presents client certificates to Connection Manager and it's difficult to pass the same certificates to the database to perform authentication. If it were to pass, the server connections are Unix socket connections (no SSL/Encryption), which makes it difficult to set up a fake SSL context in which client certificates are needed to be processed for the purpose of certificate authentication via Connection Manager. Client certificates are loaded during the initial SSL handshake of the client with the postmaster process without Connection Manager.

## SSL behaviour

Although Connection Manager supports all SSL modes that clients can set in a connection, the behaviour can be slightly different. The following corner cases can result in different behavior when using Connection Manager compared to a direct database connection:

- Enable TLS in cluster, add `{host all all all trust}` in the HBA file, and try making a connection using sslmode=disable. The connection will fail with Connection Manager, whereas it will be successfully created if connected directly to the database port.

- Enable TLS in cluster, add `{host all all all trust}` in the HBA file, and try making a connection using sslmode=allow. An encrypted connection will be created with Connection Manager, whereas when connecting to a database port an unencrypted connection will be created.

- Enable TLS in cluster and create a connection using sslmode=disable. Connection Manager will throw the following error: `odyssey: c8240c445726f: SSL is required`; whereas when connecting to the database port, the error message is `FATAL:  no pg_hba.conf entry for host`.

The main reason for these differences in behaviour is because sometimes authentication is done at the Connection Manager layer itself, rather than following the standard authentication mechanism (where authentication happens on the server based on credentials forwarded by Connection Manager).
