YugabyteDB includes a built-in connection pooler, YSQL Connection Manager. Because the manager is bundled with the product, it is convenient to manage, monitor, and configure the server connections without additional third-party tools. When combined with [smart drivers](../../drivers-orms/smart-drivers/), YSQL Connection Manager simplifies application architecture and enhances developer productivity.
