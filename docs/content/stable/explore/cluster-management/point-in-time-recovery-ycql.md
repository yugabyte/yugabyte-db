Point-in-time recovery (PITR) allows you to restore the state of your cluster's data and some types of metadata from a specific point in time. This can be relative, such as "three hours ago", or an absolute timestamp.

For more information, see [Point-in-time recovery](../../../manage/backup-restore/point-in-time-recovery). For details on the yb-admin commands, refer to [Backup and snapshot commands](../../../admin/yb-admin/#backup-and-snapshot-commands).

The following examples show how you can use the PITR feature by creating a database and populating it, creating a snapshot schedule, and restoring from a snapshot on the schedule.

Note that the examples are deliberately simplified. In many of the scenarios, you could drop the index or table to recover. Consider the examples as part of an effort to undo a larger schema change, such as a database migration, which has performed several operations.

## Set up universe

The examples run on a local multi-node YugabyteDB universe. To create a universe, see [Set up YugabyteDB universe](../../#set-up-yugabytedb-universe).

## Undo data changes

The process of undoing data changes involves creating and taking a snapshot of a table, and then performing a restore from either an absolute or relative time.

Before attempting a restore, you need to confirm that there is no restore in progress for the subject keyspace or table; if multiple restore commands are issued, the data might enter an inconsistent state. For details, see [Restore to a point in time](../../../manage/backup-restore/point-in-time-recovery/#restore-to-a-point-in-time).

### Create and snapshot a table

Create and populate a table, get a timestamp to which you'll restore, and then write a row.

1. Start the YCQL shell and connect to your local instance:

    ```sh
    ./bin/ycqlsh
    ```

1. Create a table and populate some sample data:

    ```sql
    create keyspace pitr;

    use pitr;

    create table employees (
      employee_no integer PRIMARY KEY,
      name text,
      department text,
      salary integer
    ) with transactions = { 'enabled' : true };

    insert into employees (employee_no, name, department, salary) values (1221, 'John Smith', 'Marketing', 50000);
    insert into employees (employee_no, name, department, salary) values (1222, 'Bette Davis', 'Sales', 55000);
    insert into employees (employee_no, name, department, salary) values (1223, 'Lucille Ball', 'Operations', 70000);
    insert into employees (employee_no, name, department, salary) values (1224, 'John Zimmerman', 'Sales', 60000);

    SELECT * from employees;
    ```

    ```output
     employee_no | name           | department | salary
    -------------+----------------+------------+--------
            1223 |   Lucille Ball | Operations |  70000
            1224 | John Zimmerman |      Sales |  60000
            1221 |     John Smith |  Marketing |  50000
            1222 |    Bette Davis |      Sales |  55000

    (4 rows)
    ```

1. Create a snapshot schedule for the new `pitr` keyspace from a shell prompt. In the following example, the schedule is one snapshot every minute, and each snapshot is retained for ten minutes:

    ```sh
    ./bin/yb-admin \
        -master_addresses 127.0.0.1:7100,127.0.0.2:7100,127.0.0.3:7100 \
        create_snapshot_schedule 1 10 ycql.pitr
    ```

    ```output.json
    {
        "schedule_id": "0e4ceb83-fe3d-43da-83c3-013a8ef592ca"
    }
    ```

1. Verify that a snapshot has happened:

    ```sh
    ./bin/yb-admin \
        -master_addresses 127.0.0.1:7100,127.0.0.2:7100,127.0.0.3:7100 \
        list_snapshot_schedules
    ```

    ```output.json
    {
        "schedules": [
            {
                "id": "0e4ceb83-fe3d-43da-83c3-013a8ef592ca",
                "options": {
                    "interval": "60.000s",
                    "retention": "600.000s"
                },
                "snapshots": [
                    {
                        "id": "8d588cb7-13f2-4bda-b584-e9be47a144c5",
                        "snapshot_time_utc": "2021-05-07T20:16:08.492330+0000"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }
    ```

### Restore from an absolute time

1. Get a timestamp:

    ```sh
    python -c 'import datetime; print(datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%s%f"))'
    ```

    ```output
    1620418817729963
    ```

1. Add a row for employee 9999 to the table:

    ```sql
    insert into employees (employee_no, name, department, salary) values (9999, 'Wrong Name', 'Marketing', 10000);

    select * from employees;
    ```

    ```output
     employee_no | name           | department | salary
    -------------+----------------+------------+--------
            1223 |   Lucille Ball | Operations |  70000
            9999 |     Wrong Name |  Marketing |  10000
            1224 | John Zimmerman |      Sales |  60000
            1221 |     John Smith |  Marketing |  50000
            1222 |    Bette Davis |      Sales |  55000

    (5 rows)
    ```

1. Restore the snapshot schedule to the timestamp you obtained before you added the data, at a terminal prompt:

    ```sh
    ./bin/yb-admin \
        -master_addresses 127.0.0.1:7100,127.0.0.2:7100,127.0.0.3:7100 \
        restore_snapshot_schedule 0e4ceb83-fe3d-43da-83c3-013a8ef592ca 1620418817729963
    ```

    ```output.json
    {
        "snapshot_id": "2287921b-1cf9-4bbc-ad38-e309f86f72e9",
        "restoration_id": "1c5ef7c3-a33a-46b5-a64e-3fa0c72709eb"
    }
    ```

1. Next, verify the restoration is in `RESTORED` state (you'll observe more snapshots in the list, as well):

    ```sh
    ./bin/yb-admin \
        -master_addresses 127.0.0.1:7100,127.0.0.2:7100,127.0.0.3:7100 \
        list_snapshots
    ```

    ```output
    Snapshot UUID                           State       Creation Time
    8d588cb7-13f2-4bda-b584-e9be47a144c5    COMPLETE    2023-04-20 00:24:58.246932

    97aa2968-6b56-40ce-b2c5-87d2e54e9786    COMPLETE    2023-04-20 00:31:28.319685
    Restoration UUID                        State
    1c5ef7c3-a33a-46b5-a64e-3fa0c72709eb    RESTORED
    ```

1. In the YCQL shell, verify the data is restored, and there is no row for employee 9999:

    ```sql
    ycqlsh:pitr> select * from employees;
    ```

    ```output
     employee_no | name           | department | salary
    -------------+----------------+------------+--------
            1223 |   Lucille Ball | Operations |  70000
            1224 | John Zimmerman |      Sales |  60000
            1221 |     John Smith |  Marketing |  50000
            1222 |    Bette Davis |      Sales |  55000

    (4 rows)
    ```

### Restore from a relative time

In addition to restoring to a particular timestamp, you can also restore from a relative time, such as "ten minutes ago".

When you specify a relative time, you can specify any or all of _days_, _hours_, _minutes_, and _seconds_. For example:

* `"5m"` to restore from five minutes ago
* `"1h"` to restore from one hour ago
* `"3d"` to restore from three days ago
* `"1h 5m"` to restore from one hour and five minutes ago

Relative times can be in any of the following formats (again, note that you can specify any or all of days, hours, minutes, and seconds):

* ISO 8601: `3d 4h 5m 6s`
* Abbreviated PostgreSQL: `3 d 4 hrs 5 mins 6 secs`
* Traditional PostgreSQL: `3 days 4 hours 5 minutes 6 seconds`
* SQL standard: `D H:M:S`

Refer to the yb-admin [_restore-snapshot-schedule_ command](../../../admin/yb-admin/#restore-snapshot-schedule) for more details.

## Undo metadata changes

In addition to data changes, you can also use PITR to recover from metadata changes, such as creating and altering tables, and creating indexes.

### Undo table creation

1. Using the same keyspace as the previous scenarios, create a new table:

    ```sql
    create table t2(k int primary key);
    ```

1. Restore back to a time before this table was created, as described in [Restore from a relative time](#restore-from-a-relative-time).

1. Due to a ycqlsh caching issue, to check the effect of this change you need to drop out of your current ycqlsh session and log back in.

1. Check that table t2 is gone:

    ```sh
    ./bin/ycqlsh -e 'use pitr; describe tables;'
    ```

    ```output
    employees
    ```

### Undo table alteration

#### Undo column addition

1. Using the same keyspace as the previous scenarios, alter your table by adding a column:

    ```sql
    alter table pitr.employees add v2 int;
    select * from pitr.employees;
    ```

    ```output
     employee_no | name           | department | salary |  v2
    -------------+----------------+------------+--------+------
            1223 |   Lucille Ball | Operations |  70000 | null
            1224 | John Zimmerman |      Sales |  60000 | null
            1221 |     John Smith |  Marketing |  50000 | null
            1222 |    Bette Davis |      Sales |  55000 | null

    (4 rows)
    ```

1. Restore back to a time before this table was altered, as described in [Restore from a relative time](#restore-from-a-relative-time).

1. Due to a ycqlsh caching issue, to check the effect of this change you need to drop out of your current ycqlsh session and log back in.

1. Check that the v2 column is gone:

    ```sql
    ycqlsh:pitr> select * from employees;
    ```

    ```output
     employee_no | name           | department | salary
    -------------+----------------+------------+--------
            1223 |   Lucille Ball | Operations |  70000
            1224 | John Zimmerman |      Sales |  60000
            1221 |     John Smith |  Marketing |  50000
            1222 |    Bette Davis |      Sales |  55000

    (4 rows)
    ```

#### Undo column deletion

1. Using the same keyspace as the previous scenarios, alter your table by dropping a column:

    ```sql
    alter table pitr.employees drop salary;
    select * from pitr.employees;
    ```

    ```output
     employee_no | name           | department
    -------------+----------------+-----------
            1223 |   Lucille Ball | Operations
            1224 | John Zimmerman |      Sales
            1221 |     John Smith |  Marketing
            1222 |    Bette Davis |      Sales

    (4 rows)
    ```

1. Restore back to a time before this table was altered, as described in [Restore from a relative time](#restore-from-a-relative-time).

1. Due to a ycqlsh caching issue, to check the effect of this change you need to drop out of your current ycqlsh session and log back in.

1. Verify that the salary column is back:

    ```sql
    ycqlsh:pitr> select * from employees;
    ```

    ```output
     employee_no | name           | department | salary
    -------------+----------------+------------+--------
            1223 |   Lucille Ball | Operations |  70000
            1224 | John Zimmerman |      Sales |  60000
            1221 |     John Smith |  Marketing |  50000
            1222 |    Bette Davis |      Sales |  55000

    (4 rows)
    ```

### Undo index creation

1. Create an index on the table from the previous examples:

    ```sql
    use pitr;
    create index t1_index on employees (employee_no);
    describe index t1_index;
    ```

    ```output
    CREATE INDEX t1_index ON pitr.employees (employee_no)
    WITH transactions = {'enabled': 'true'};
    ```

1. Restore back to a time before this index was created.

1. Due to a ycqlsh caching issue, to check the effect of this change you need to drop out of your current ycqlsh session and log back in.

1. Verify that the index is gone:

    ```sh
    ./bin/ycqlsh -e 'describe index pitr.t1_index;'
    ```

    ```output
    <stdin>:1:Index u't1_index' not found
    ```

### Undo table and index deletion

1. Create a second table called `dont_deleteme`:

    ```sql
    create table dont_deleteme (
      oops integer PRIMARY KEY,
      mistake text
    ) with transactions = { 'enabled' : true };

    describe tables;
    ```

    ```output
    employees  dont_deleteme
    ```

1. Create an index on the table from the previous examples:

    ```sql
    use pitr;
    create index t1_index on employees (employee_no);
    describe index t1_index;
    ```

    ```output
    CREATE INDEX t1_index ON pitr.employees (employee_no)
    WITH transactions = {'enabled': 'true'};
    ```

1. Wait a minute or two, then delete the new table and index:

    ```sql
    drop table dont_deleteme;
    drop index t1_index;
    ```

1. Restore back to a time before you deleted the table and index, as described in [Restore from a relative time](#restore-from-a-relative-time).

1. Verify that the index and table are restored:

    ```sh
    ./bin/ycqlsh -e 'describe table pitr.dont_deleteme; describe index pitr.t1_index;'
    ```

    ```output
    CREATE TABLE pitr.dont_deleteme (
        oops int PRIMARY KEY,
        mistake text
    ) WITH default_time_to_live = 0
        AND transactions = {'enabled': 'true'};

    CREATE INDEX t1_index ON pitr.employees (employee_no)
        WITH transactions = {'enabled': 'true'};
    ```
