PostgreSQL Partition Manager (pg_partman) is an extension to create and manage both time-based and serial-based table partition sets. pg_partman simplifies managing table partitions based on time or serial IDs, automating their creation and maintenance. While it includes many options, only a few are typically needed, making it user-friendly.

Partitioning in YugabyteDB refers to physically dividing large tables into smaller, more manageable tables to improve performance. Typically, tables with columns containing timestamps are subject to partitioning because of the historical and predictable nature of their data.

YugabyteDB fully supports pg_partman, with some minor [limitations](#limitations) due to its distributed nature that don't hinder partition management.

## Enable pg_partman

Enable the pg_partman extension separately for each database.

To enable  pg_partman for a specific database, create the partition maintenance schema (by default the `public` schema is selected), and then create the pg_partman extension. For example:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA partman;
CREATE EXTENSION pg_partman WITH SCHEMA partman;
```

## Use pg_partman

To demonstrate its use, create the following sample database table, `orders`, partitioned based on a timestamp column:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id SERIAL,
    order_date DATE NOT NULL,
    customer_id INT
) PARTITION BY RANGE (order_date);
```

### create_parent function

After you enable pg_partman, use the `create_parent()` function to set up table partitions. This function allows you to configure partitions in the schema designated for partition maintenance.

Use the `create_parent()` function as follows:

```sql
SELECT partman.create_parent(
    p_parent_table => 'public.orders',
    p_control => 'order_date',
    p_type => 'native',
    p_interval => 'monthly',
    p_premake => 5
);
```

- p_parent_table - Parent partitioned table.
- p_control - Column on which table partitioning is done. Must be an integer or time-based.
- p_type - Either 'native' or 'partman'.

  - native - Use the native partitioning methods that are built into PostgreSQL 10+.
  - partman - Create a trigger-based partition set; this is [not available in YugabyteDB](#supported-partitioning-methods).

- p_interval – The time interval or integer range for each partition. For example, daily, hourly, monthly, and so on.
- p_premake – The number of partitions to create in advance to support new inserts.

### part_config table

The `part_config` table stores all configuration data for partition sets managed by pg_partman. A new row for the partition table is added after calling the [create_parent() function](#create-parent-function).

The `part_config` table can be used to make decisions about:

- What new partitions to create.
- Which old partitions to drop or detach from the partition set.
- What table updates are required.

{{<lead link="https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/blob/master/src/postgres/third-party-extensions/pg_partman/doc/pg_partman.md#tables">}}
For more information, see [Tables](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/blob/master/src/postgres/third-party-extensions/pg_partman/doc/pg_partman.md#tables) in the pg_partman documentation
{{</lead>}}

An example is as follows:

```sql
SELECT parent_table, control, partition_interval, premake, retention FROM partman.part_config;
```

```output
 parent_table  |  control   | partition_interval | premake | retention
---------------+------------+--------------------+---------+-----------
 public.orders | order_date | 1 mon              |       5 |
```

You can update the `part_config` table as follows:

```sql
UPDATE partman.part_config
SET partition_interval = 2 months
WHERE parent_table = 'public.orders';
```

### Maintain partitions using pg_cron

[pg_cron](../extension-pgcron) is a cron-based job scheduler for PostgreSQL that runs inside a database as an extension.

You can schedule the pg_partman `run_maintenance()` function, which automatically creates child tables and drops old child partitions, using pg_cron. For example:

1. Load the pg_cron extension as follows:

    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION pg_cron;
    ```

1. Update the `part_config` table retention-related fields as follows:

    ```sql
    UPDATE partman.part_config
    SET retention = '3 months',
    retention_keep_table=true
    WHERE parent_table = 'public.orders';
    ```

    - retention - Sets the maximum retention for the table.
    - retention_keep_table - When set to true, specifies that the table is only detached from the partition set and isn't deleted automatically.

1. Schedule the `run_maintenance()` call using the `cron.schedule` procedure as follows:

    ```sql
    SELECT cron.schedule(
        'Run maintenance job',
        '10 seconds',
        'SELECT partman.run_maintenance()'
    );
    ```

1. Monitor the scheduled maintenance job by querying the `cron.job` table as follows:

    ```sql
    SELECT jobid, schedule, command, jobname FROM cron.job;
    ```

    ```output

     jobid |  schedule  |             command              |       jobname
    -------+------------+----------------------------------+----------+-------------
         1 | 10 seconds | SELECT partman.run_maintenance() | Run maintenance job
    ```

## Limitations

The pg_partman extension has the following limitations in YugabyteDB.

These limitations ensure that pg_partman features align with the capabilities and architecture of YugabyteDB, maintaining system performance and stability. You should adjust your use of partitioning strategies accordingly to adhere to these constraints.

### Supported partitioning methods

Only native partitioning is supported in YugabyteDB. Non-native partitioning, which uses table inheritance and triggers to route data to the appropriate child tables, is not supported because YugabyteDB does not support table inheritance.

Versions of pg_partman later than v4.7.4 have deprecated non-native partitioning, so migrating partition sets from non-native to native partitioning methods can be challenging.

The following example shows an unsupported operation using non-native partitioning:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA partman;

CREATE EXTENSION pg_partman WITH SCHEMA partman;

CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id SERIAL,
  order_date DATE NOT NULL,
  customer_id INT
) PARTITION BY RANGE (order_date);

CREATE EXTENSION pg_partman WITH SCHEMA partman;

CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id SERIAL,
  order_date DATE NOT NULL,
  customer_id INT
) PARTITION BY RANGE (order_date);

SELECT partman.create_parent( p_parent_table => 'public.orders',
  p_control => 'order_date',
  p_type => 'partman',
  p_interval =>'monthly',
  p_premake => 5
);
```

```output
ERROR:  partman is not a valid partitioning type for pg_partman
```

### ACCESS EXCLUSIVE LOCK

The pg_partman `create_parent()` function requires an access exclusive lock on the parent table to create new child partitions. Currently, access exclusive locks are not supported in YugabyteDB, and are disabled in this function.

### ADVISORY LOCKS

Advisory locks, used in some pg_partman functions to create, drop/delete partitioned tables, are not supported in YugabyteDB. Attempts to acquire these locks are disabled.

### Background worker process

The pg_partman background worker process, which automates partition maintenance without the need of an external scheduler, is disabled in favor of using pg_cron to manage such tasks externally.

### undo_partition function

The `undo_partition()` function, which moves data from child tables back to a target table, is disabled.

As part of `undo_partition()`, all data from child partitions is moved out to the target table and after that the child table is detached from the parent table. This is done in an iterative manner, looping through each child.

`undo_partition()` is disabled because YugabyteDB does not currently support transactional DDL operations (the DMLs (deleting data from child tables) and DDLs (detaching child tables) will cause conflicts), which are required for this functionality.

For example:

```sql
SELECT partman.undo_partition(p_parent_table => 'public.orders');
```

```output
ERROR:  undo_partition not supported yet in YugabyteDB
```

### Default partition creation

Creation and use of default partitions are disabled. If a default partition is created, `partition_data_proc` and `run_maintenance()` operations will exit early without performing any operation.

For example:

```sql
SELECT partman.create_parent( p_parent_table => 'public.orders',
  p_control => 'order_date',
  p_type => 'native',
  p_interval =>'monthly',
  p_premake => 5
);
```

```output
  create_parent
---------------
  t
(1 row)
```

```sql
\d
```

```output
                      List of relations
  Schema |        Name         |       Type        |  Owner
--------+---------------------+-------------------+----------
  public | orders              | partitioned table | yugabyte
  public | orders_order_id_seq | sequence          | yugabyte
  public | orders_p2024_06     | table             | yugabyte
  public | orders_p2024_07     | table             | yugabyte
  public | orders_p2024_08     | table             | yugabyte
  public | orders_p2024_09     | table             | yugabyte
  public | orders_p2024_10     | table             | yugabyte
  public | orders_p2024_11     | table             | yugabyte
  public | orders_p2024_12     | table             | yugabyte
  public | orders_p2025_01     | table             | yugabyte
  public | orders_p2025_02     | table             | yugabyte
  public | orders_p2025_03     | table             | yugabyte
  public | orders_p2025_04     | table             | yugabyte
(13 rows)

No default partition created
```

If you try to create a default partition explicitly and call `run_maintenance()`, the run maintenance job is skipped as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders_default PARTITION OF orders DEFAULT;
SELECT partman.run_maintenance('public.orders');
```

```output
NOTICE:  Skip run maintenace job for table public.orders as it has default table attached
  run_maintenance
-----------------

(1 row)
```

### Colocated databases

Registration of a partitioned table for maintenance by pg_partman is not allowed if the table belongs to a colocated database.

For example:

```sql
yugabyte=# CREATE DATABASE mo WITH colocation=true;
yugabyte=# \c mo

mo=# SELECT create_parent( p_parent_table => 'public.orders',
  p_control => 'order_date',
  p_type => 'native',
  p_interval =>'monthly',
  p_premake => 5);

mo=# CREATE extension pg_partman;

mo=# SELECT create_parent( p_parent_table => 'public.orders',
  p_control => 'order_date',
  p_type => 'native',
  p_interval =>'monthly',
  p_premake => 5);
```

```output
ERROR:  Partition table public.orders is a colocated table hence registering it to pg_partman maintenance is not supported
```
