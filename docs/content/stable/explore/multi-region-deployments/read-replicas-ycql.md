YugabyteDB supports the following types of reads:

- [Follower reads](../../going-beyond-sql/follower-reads-ycql/) that enable spreading the read workload across all replicas in the primary cluster.
- Observer reads that use read replicas. Read replicas are created as a separate cluster that may be located in a different region, possibly closer to the consumers of the data which would result in lower-latency access and enhanced support of analytics workloads.

A data center (also known as a [universe](../../../architecture/key-concepts/#universe)) can have one primary cluster and several read replica clusters.

Stale reads are possible with an upper bound on the amount of staleness. Reads are guaranteed to be timeline-consistent. You need to set the consistency level to `ONE` in your application to work with follower reads or observer reads. In addition, you have to set the application's local data center to the read replica cluster's region.

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have downloaded and configured YugabyteDB, as described in [Quick start](/preview/tutorials/quick-start/).

{{< note title="Note" >}}

This document uses a client application based on the [yb-sample-apps](https://github.com/yugabyte/yb-sample-apps) workload generator.

{{< /note >}}

Also, because you cannot use read replicas without a primary cluster, ensure that you have the latter available. The following command sets up a primary cluster of three nodes in cloud `c`, region `r` and zones `z1`, `z2`, and `z3`:

```shell
$ ./bin/yb-ctl create --rf 3 --placement_info "c.r.z1,c.r.z2,c.r.z3" --tserver_flags "placement_uuid=live,max_stale_read_bound_time_ms=60000000"
```

Output:

```output

```

The following command instructs the masters to create three replicas for each tablet distributed across the three zones:

```shell
$ ./bin/yb-admin -master_addresses 127.0.0.1:7100,127.0.0.2:7100,127.0.0.3:7100 modify_placement_info c.r.z1,c.r.z2,c.r.z3 3 live
```

The following illustration demonstrates the primary cluster visible via [YugabyteDB Anywhere](../../../yugabyte-platform/):

The following command runs the sample application and starts a YCQL workload:

```shell
java -jar ./yb-sample-apps.jar --workload CassandraKeyValue \
                               --nodes 127.0.0.1:9042,127.0.0.2:9042,127.0.0.3:9042 \
                               --nouuid \
                               --num_unique_keys 2 \
                               --num_threads_write 1 \
                               --num_threads_read 1 \
                               --value_size 1024
```

```

The following illustration demonstrates the read and write statistics in the primary cluster visible via YugabyteDB Anywhere:

![Primary cluster reads and writes](/images/explore/multi-region-deployments/read-replicas2.png)

As per the preceding illustration, using the default workload directs reads and writes to the tablet leader. The arguments in the `java -jar ./yb-sample-apps.jar` command explicitly restrict the number of keys to be written and read to one in order to follow the reads and writes occurring on a single tablet.

The following is a modified command that enables follower reads. Specifying `--local_reads` changes the consistency level to `ONE`. The `--with_local_dc` option defines in which data center the application is at any given time. When specified, the read traffic is routed to the same region:

```shell
$ java -jar ./yb-sample-apps.jar --workload CassandraKeyValue \
                                 --nodes 127.0.0.1:9042,127.0.0.2:9042,127.0.0.3:9042 \
                                 --nouuid \
                                 --num_unique_keys 2 \
                                 --num_threads_write 1 \
                                 --num_threads_read 1 \
                                 --value_size 1024 --local_reads --with_local_dc r
```

The following illustration demonstrates the reads spread across all the replicas for the tablet visible via YugabyteDB Anywhere:

![Read replica reads](/images/explore/multi-region-deployments/read-replicas3.png)

## Using read replicas

The following commands add three new nodes to a read replica cluster in region `r2`:

```shell
./bin/yb-ctl add_node --placement_info "c.r2.z21" --tserver_flags "placement_uuid=rr"
./bin/yb-ctl add_node --placement_info "c.r2.z22" --tserver_flags "placement_uuid=rr"
./bin/yb-ctl add_node --placement_info "c.r2.z23" --tserver_flags "placement_uuid=rr"

./bin/yb-admin -master_addresses 127.0.0.1:7100,127.0.0.2,127.0.0.3 add_read_replica_placement_info c.r2.z21:1,c.r2.z22:1,c.r2.z23:1 3 rr
```

The following illustration demonstrates the setup of the two clusters, one of which is primary and another one is read replica visible via YugabyteDB Anywhere:

![Primary and read replica](/images/explore/multi-region-deployments/read-replicas4.png)

The following command directs `CL.ONE` reads to the primary cluster (as follower reads) in region `r`:

```shell
java -jar ./yb-sample-apps.jar --workload CassandraKeyValue \
                               --nodes 127.0.0.1:9042,127.0.0.2:9042,127.0.0.3:9042 \
                               --nouuid \
                               --num_unique_keys 2 \
                               --num_threads_write 1 \
                               --num_threads_read 1 \
                               --value_size 1024 --local_reads --with_local_dc r
```

The following illustration demonstrates the result of executing the preceding command (visible via YugabyteDB Anywhere):

![Primary cluster reads](/images/explore/multi-region-deployments/read-replicas5.png)

The following command directs the `CL.ONE` reads to the read replica cluster (as observer reads) in region `r2`:

```shell
java -jar ./yb-sample-apps.jar --workload CassandraKeyValue \
                               --nodes 127.0.0.1:9042,127.0.0.2:9042,127.0.0.3:9042 \
                               --nouuid \
                               --num_unique_keys 2 \
                               --num_threads_write 1 \
                               --num_threads_read 1 \
                               --value_size 1024 --local_reads --with_local_dc r2
```

The following illustration demonstrates the result of executing the preceding command (visible via YugabyteDB Anywhere):

For information on deploying read replicas, see [Read Replica Clusters](../../../deploy/multi-dc/read-replica-clusters/).

## Fault tolerance

In the strong consistency mode (default), more failures can be tolerated by increasing the number of replicas: to tolerate a `k` number of failures, `2k+1` replicas are required in the Raft group. However, follower reads and observer reads can provide Cassandra-style `CL.ONE` fault tolerance. The  `max_stale_read_bound_time_ms` GFlag controls how far behind the followers are allowed to be before they redirect reads back to the Raft leader (the default is 60 seconds). For "write once, read many times" workloads, this number could be increased. By stopping nodes, you can induce behavior of follower and observer reads such that they continue to read (which would not be possible without follower reads).

The following command starts a read-only workload:

```shell
java -jar ./yb-sample-apps.jar --workload CassandraKeyValue \
  --nodes 127.0.0.1:9042,127.0.0.2:9042,127.0.0.3:9042 \
  --nouuid \
  --max_written_key 2 \
  --read_only \
  --num_threads_read 1 \
  --value_size 1024 --local_reads --with_local_dc r2 --skip_ddl
```

The following command stops a node in the read replica cluster:

```shell
./bin/yb-ctl stop_node 6
```

The following illustration demonstrates the stopped node visible via YugabyteDB Anywhere:

![Read replica with stopped node](/images/explore/multi-region-deployments/read-replicas7.png)

Stopping one node redistributes the load onto the two remaining nodes.

The following command stops another node in the read replica cluster:

```shell
./bin/yb-ctl stop_node 5
```

The following illustration demonstrates two stopped nodes visible via YugabyteDB Anywhere:

![Read replica with two stopped nodes](/images/explore/multi-region-deployments/read-replicas8.png)

The following command stops the last node in the read replica cluster which causes the reads revert back to the primary cluster and become follower reads:

```shell
./bin/yb-ctl stop_node 4
```

The following illustration demonstrates all stopped nodes in the read replica cluster and activation of nodes in the primary cluster visible via YugabyteDB Anywhere:

![Read replica with three stopped nodes](/images/explore/multi-region-deployments/read-replicas9.png)

This behavior differs from the standard Cassandra behavior. The YCQL interface only honors consistency level `ONE`. All other consistency levels are converted to `QUORUM` including `LOCAL_ONE`. When a local data center is specified by the application with consistency level `ONE`, read traffic is localized to the region as long as this region has active replicas. If the application's local data center has no replicas, the read traffic is routed to the primary region.

The following command stops one of the nodes in the primary cluster:

```shell
./bin/yb-ctl stop_node 3
```

The following illustration demonstrates the state of nodes, with read load rebalanced to the remaining nodes visible via YugabyteDB Anywhere:

![Primary cluster with one stopped node](/images/explore/multi-region-deployments/read-replicas10.png)

The following command stops one more node in the primary cluster:

```shell
./bin/yb-ctl stop_node 2
```

The following illustration demonstrates that the entire read load moved to the one remaining node visible via YugabyteDB Anywhere:

![Primary cluster with two stopped nodes](/images/explore/multi-region-deployments/read-replicas11.png)
