Active Session History (ASH) provides a current and historical view of system activity by sampling session activity in the database. A database session or connection is considered active if it is consuming CPU, or has an active RPC call that is waiting on one of the wait events.

ASH exposes session activity in the form of [SQL views](../../ysql-language-features/advanced-features/views/) so that you can run analytical queries, aggregations for analysis, and troubleshoot performance issues. To run ASH queries, you need to enable [YSQL](../../../api/ysql/).

Currently, ASH is available for [YSQL](../../../api/ysql/), [YCQL](../../../api/ycql/), and [YB-TServer](../../../architecture/yb-tserver/). ASH facilitates analysis by recording wait events related to YSQL, YCQL, or YB-TServer requests while they are being executed. These wait events belong to the categories including but not limited to _CPU_, _WaitOnCondition_, _Network_, and _Disk IO_.

Analyzing the wait events and wait event types lets you troubleshoot, answer the following questions, and subsequently tune performance:

- Why is a query taking longer than usual to execute?
- Why is a particular application slow?
- What are the queries that are contributing significantly to database load and performance?

## Configure ASH

To use ASH, enable and configure the following flags for each node of your cluster.

| Flag | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| allowed_preview_flags_csv | Set the value of this flag to include `ysql_yb_ash_enable_infra,ysql_yb_enable_ash`. |
| ysql_yb_ash_enable_infra | Enable or disable ASH infrastructure. <br>Default: false. Changing this flag requires a VM restart. |
| ysql_yb_enable_ash | Works only in conjunction with the flag `ysql_yb_ash_enable_infra`. Setting this flag to true enables the collection of wait events for YSQL and YCQL queries, and YB-TServer requests.<br> Default: false. Changing this flag doesn't require a VM restart. |

### Additional flags

You can also use the following flags based on your requirements.

| Flag | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| ysql_yb_ash_circular_buffer_size | Size (in KBs) of circular buffer where the samples are stored. <br> Defaults:<ul><li>32 MB for 1-2 cores</li><li>64 MB for 3-4 cores</li><li>128 MB for 5-8 cores</li><li>256 MB for 9-16 cores</li><li>512 MB for 17-32 cores</li><li>1024 MB for more than 32 cores</li></ul> Changing this flag requires a VM restart. |
| ysql_yb_ash_sampling_interval_ms | Sampling interval (in milliseconds). <br>Default: 1000. Changing this flag doesn't require a VM restart. |
| ysql_yb_ash_sample_size | Maximum number of events captured per sampling interval. <br>Default: 500. Changing this flag doesn't require a VM restart. |

## Limitations

Note that the following limitations are subject to change as the feature is in [Tech Preview](/preview/releases/versioning/#feature-maturity).

- ASH is available per node and is not aggregated across the cluster.
- ASH is not available for [YB-Master](../../../architecture/yb-master/) processes.
- ASH is available for queries and a few background activities like compaction and flushes. ASH support for other background activities will be added in future releases.

<!-- While ASH is not available for most background activities such as backups, restore, remote bootstrap, CDC, tablet splitting. ASH is available for flushes and compactions.
Work done in the TServer process is tracked, even for remote-bootstrap etc. However, we do not collect them under a specific query-id of sorts.

copy/export done using scripts outside of the TServer process is not tracked.
-->

## YSQL views

ASH exposes the following views in each node to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues.

### yb_active_session_history

This view provides a list of wait events and their metadata. The columns of the view are described in the following table.

| Column | Type | Description |
| :----- | :--- | :---------- |
| sample_time | timestamp | Timestamp when the sample was captured |
| root_request_id | UUID | A 16-byte UUID that is generated per request. Generated for queries at YSQL/YCQL layer. |
| rpc_request_id | integer | ID for internal requests, it is a monotonically increasing number for the lifetime of a YB-TServer. |
| wait_event_component | text | Component of the wait event, which can be YSQL, YCQL, or TServer. |
| wait_event_class | text | Class of the wait event, such as TabletWait, RocksDB, and so on.  |
| wait_event | text | Name of the wait event. |
| wait_event_type | text | Type of the wait event such as CPU, WaitOnCondition, Network, Disk IO, and so on. |
| wait_event_aux | text | Additional information for the wait event. For example, tablet ID for TServer wait events. |
| top_level_node_id | UUID | 16-byte TServer UUID of the YSQL/YCQL node where the query is being executed. |
| query_id | bigint | Query ID as seen on the `/statements` endpoint. This can be used to join with [pg_stat_statements](../../query-1-performance/pg-stat-statements/)/[ycql_stat_statements](../../query-1-performance/ycql-stat-statements/). It is set as a known constant for background activities. For example, _flush_ is 2, _compaction_ is 3, and so on. |
| pid | bigint | PID of the process that is executing the query. For YCQL and background activites, this will be the YB-TServer PID. |
| client_node_ip | text | IP address of the client which sent the query to YSQL/YCQL. Null for background activities. |
| sample_weight | float | If in any sampling interval there are too many events, YugabyteDB only collects `ysql_yb_ash_sample_size` samples/events. Based on how many were sampled, weights are assigned to the collected events. <br><br>For example, if there are 200 events, but only 100 events are collected, each of the collected samples will have a weight of (200 / 100) = 2.0 |
| ysql_dbid | oid | Database OID of the YSQL database. This is 0 for YCQL databases.  |

### yb_wait_event_desc

This view displays the class, type, name, and description of each wait event. The columns of the view are described in the following table.

| Column | Type | Description |
| :----- | :--- | :---------- |
| wait_event_class | text | Class of the wait event, such as TabletWait, RocksDB, and so on. |
| wait_event_type | text | Type of the wait event such as CPU, WaitOnCondition, Network, Disk IO, and so on. |
| wait_event | text | Name of the wait event. |
| wait_event_description | text | Description of the wait event. |

## Constant query identifiers

These fixed constants are used to identify various YugabyteDB background activities. The query ids of the fixed constants are described in the following table.

| Query id | Wait Event Component | Description |
| :------- | :------------------- | :---------- |
| 1 | TServer | Query id for write ahead log (WAL) appender thread. |
| 2 | TServer | Query id for background flush tasks. |
| 3 | TServer | Query id for background compaction tasks. |
| 4 | TServer | Query id for Raft update consensus. |

### Distribution of wait events for each query_id

Check the distribution of wait events for each query_id, for the last 20 minutes.

```sql
SELECT
    query_id,
    wait_event_component,
    wait_event,
    wait_event_type,
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    yb_active_session_history

```

### Distribution of wait events for each query

As ASH's query_id is the same as [pg_stat_statement's](../../query-1-performance/pg-stat-statements/) queryid, you can join with pg_stat_statements to view the distribution of wait events for each query. This may help in finding what's wrong with a particular query, or determine where most of the time is being spent on. In this example, you can see that in YB-TServer, most of the time is spent on the wait event `ConflictResolution_WaitOnConflictingTxns` which suggests that there are a lot of conflicts in the [DocDB storage layer](../../../architecture/docdb/).

```sql
SELECT
    SUBSTRING(query, 1, 50) AS query,
    wait_event_component,
    wait_event,
    wait_event_type,
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    yb_active_session_history
JOIN
    pg_stat_statements
ON
    query_id = queryid
WHERE
    sample_time >= current_timestamp - interval '20 minutes'
GROUP BY
    query,
    wait_event_component,
    wait_event,
    wait_event_type
ORDER BY
    query,
    wait_event_component,
    wait_event_type;
```

```output
                query                          | wait_event_component |             wait_event                   | wait_event_type | count

```

### Detect a hot shard

In this example, you can see that a particular tablet is getting a lot of requests as compared to the other tablets. The `wait_event_aux` field contains the `tablet_id` in case of YB-TServer events.

```sql
SELECT
    wait_event_aux AS tablet_id,
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    yb_active_session_history
WHERE
    wait_event_component = 'TServer' AND
    wait_event_aux IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    wait_event_aux
ORDER BY
    count DESC;
```

```output
    tablet_id    | count

```

You can join with `yb_local_tablets` to get more information about the table type, table_name, and partition keys. As the `wait_event_aux` has only the first 15 characters of the `tablet_id` as a string, you have to join with only the first 15 characters from `yb_local_tablets`.

```sql
SELECT
    tablet_id,
    table_type,
    namespace_name,

You can see that only a single tablet of the table `test_table` is getting most of the requests, and you have the partition range of that particular tablet.

### Distribution of the type of the wait events for each component

Detect where most time is being spent to help understand if the issue is related to disk IO, network operations, waiting for a condition or lock, or intense CPU work.

```sql
SELECT
    wait_event_component,
    wait_event_type,
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    yb_active_session_history
GROUP BY
    wait_event_component,
    wait_event_type
ORDER BY
    wait_event_component,
    count;
```

```output
 wait_event_component | wait_event_type | count
----------------------+-----------------+-------
 TServer              | WaitOnCondition |    47
 TServer              | Network         |   910
 TServer              | Cpu             |  2665
 TServer              | DiskIO          |  8193
 YSQL                 | LWLock          |     1
 YSQL                 | Cpu             |  1479
 YSQL                 | Network         |  4575
```

### Detect which client/application is sending the most amount of queries

Suppose you have a rogue application which is sending a lot of queries, you can identify the application using the following example query:

```sql
SELECT
    client_node_ip,
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    yb_active_session_history
WHERE
    client_node_ip IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    client_node_ip;
```

```output
 client_node_ip  |  count
-----------------+-------
 127.0.0.2:56471 |    92
 127.0.0.1:56473 |   106
 127.0.0.1:56477 |    91
 127.0.0.2:56481 |    51
 127.0.0.3:56475 |    53
 127.0.0.3:56485 |    18
 127.0.0.3:56479 | 10997
```
