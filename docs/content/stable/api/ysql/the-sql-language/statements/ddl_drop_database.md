## Synopsis

Use the `DROP DATABASE` statement to remove a database and all of its associated objects from the system. This is an irreversible statement. A currently-open connection to the database will be invalidated and then closed as soon as the statement is executed using that connection.

## Syntax

{{%ebnf%}}
  drop_database
{{%/ebnf%}}

## Semantics

### *drop_database*

#### DROP DATABASE [ IF EXISTS ] *database_name*

Remove a database and all associated objects. All objects that are associated with `database_name` such as tables will be invalidated after the drop statement is completed. All connections to the dropped database would be invalidated and eventually disconnected.

### *database_name*

Specify the name of the database.
