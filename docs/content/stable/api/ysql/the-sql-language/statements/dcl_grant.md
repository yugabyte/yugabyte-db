## Semantics

`GRANT` can be used to assign privileges on database objects as well as memberships in roles.

### `GRANT` on database objects

This variant of `GRANT` command is used to assign privileges on database objects to one or more roles.
If keyword `PUBLIC` is used instead of `role_name`, then it means that the privileges are to be granted to all roles, including those that might be created later.

If `WITH GRANT OPTION` is specified, the recipient of the privilege can in turn grant it to others. Without a grant option, the recipient cannot do that. Grant options cannot be granted to `PUBLIC`.

There is no need to grant privileges to the owner of an object (usually the user that created it), as the owner has all privileges by default. (The owner could, however, choose to revoke some of their own privileges for safety.)

Possible privileges are

- SELECT

  - This allows SELECT from any or specified columns of the specified table, view, or sequence. It also allows the use of COPY TO. This privilege is also needed to reference column values in UPDATE or DELETE.

- INSERT

  - This allows INSERT of a row into the specified table. If specific columns are listed, only those columns may be assigned to in the INSERT command (other columns will therefore receive default values). Also allows COPY FROM.

- UPDATE

  - This allows UPDATE of any column, or the specific columns listed, of the specified table.

- DELETE
  - This allows DELETE of a row from the specified table.

- TRUNCATE

  - This allows TRUNCATE on the specified table.

- REFERENCES

  - This allows creation of a foreign key constraint referencing the specified table, or specified columns of the table.

- TRIGGER

  - This allows the creation of a trigger on the specified table.

- CREATE

  - For databases, this allows schemas to be created within the database.
  - For schemas, this allows objects to be created within the schema. To rename an object, you must own the object and have this privilege for the containing schema.

- CONNECT

  - This allows the user to connect to the specified database. This privilege is checked at connection startup.

- TEMPORARY / TEMP

  - This allows temporary tables to be created while using the specified database.

- EXECUTE

  - Allows the use of the specified function or procedure and the use of any operators that are implemented on top of the function.

- USAGE

  - For schemas, this allows access to objects contained in the specified schema (assuming that the objects' own privilege requirements are also met). Essentially this allows the grantee to “look up” objects within the schema.
  - For sequences, this privilege allows the use of the `currval()` and `nextval()` functions.
  - For types and domains, this privilege allows the use of the type or domain in the creation of tables, functions, and other schema objects.

- ALL PRIVILEGES

  - Grant all privileges at once.

### `GRANT` on roles

This variant of `GRANT` is used to grant membership in a role to one or more other roles.
If `WITH ADMIN OPTION` is specified, the member can in turn grant membership in the role to others, and revoke membership in the role as well.

## Examples

- Grant SELECT privilege to all users on table 'stores'

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# GRANT SELECT ON stores TO PUBLIC;
```

- Add user John to SysAdmins group.

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# GRANT SysAdmins TO John;
```
