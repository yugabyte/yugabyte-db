## Synopsis

Use the `DROP FUNCTION` statement to remove a function from a database.

## Syntax

{{%ebnf%}}
  drop_function,
  subprogram_signature,
  arg_decl
{{%/ebnf%}}

You must identify the to-be-dropped function by:

- Its name and the schema where it lives. This can be done by using its fully qualified name or by using just its bare name and letting name resolution find it in the first schema on the _search_path_ where it occurs. Notice that you don't need to (and cannot) mention the name of its owner.

- Its signature. The _[subprogram_call_signature](../../../user-defined-subprograms-and-anon-blocks/subprogram-overloading/#subprogram-call-signature)_ is sufficient; and this is typically used. You can use the full _subprogram_signature_. But you should realize that the _formal_arg_ and _arg_mode_ for each _arg_decl_ carry no identifying information. (This is why it is not typically used when a function or procedure is to be altered or dropped.) This is explained in the section [Subprogram overloading](../../../user-defined-subprograms-and-anon-blocks/subprogram-overloading/).

## Semantics

- An error will be thrown if the function does not exist unless `IF EXISTS` is used. Then a notice is issued instead.

- `RESTRICT` is the default and it will not drop the function if any objects depend on it.

- `CASCADE` will drop any objects that transitively depend on the function.

## Examples

```plpgsql
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS inc(i integer), mul(integer, integer) CASCADE;
```
