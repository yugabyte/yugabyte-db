The function _moment_moment_subtraction()_ models the algorithm for this operation for a pair of _timestamptz_ values. Create it thus:

```plpgsql
drop function if exists moment_moment_subtraction(timestamptz, timestamptz) cascade;

create function moment_moment_subtraction(t1 timestamptz, t2 timestamptz)
  returns interval
  language plpgsql
as $body$
declare
  s1       constant double precision not null := extract(epoch from t1);
  s2       constant double precision not null := extract(epoch from t2);
  i_model  constant interval         not null := justify_hours(make_interval(secs=>(s1 - s2)));

  i_actual constant interval         not null := t1 - t2;
begin
  assert i_model = i_actual, 'assert failed';
  return i_model;
end;
$body$;
```

The _extract(epoch from...)_ function, for a _timestamp_ argument, determines the number of seconds from the so-called start of the epoch, _'1970-01-01 00:00:00'_, to the specified moment. For a _timestamptz_ argument, the epoch simply starts, as you'd expect, at _'1970-01-01 00:00:00 +00'_. And for a _time_ argument, the epoch starts at midnight.

See the section _[justify_hours](../../justfy-and-extract-epoch/#justify-hours)_ for the explanation of the semantics of the function. This semantics is dubious for the case of creating an _interval_ value by subtracting one _timestamptz_ value from another because you are very likely to produce a hybrid _interval_ value.

Notice that the _moment_moment_subtraction()_ function uses an _assert_ statement to check that the result of the modeled implementation agrees with that of the actual implementation. Test it like this:

```plpgsql
select moment_moment_subtraction(
  '2021-03-14 20:00:00 America/Los_Angeles'::timestamptz,
  '2021-03-13 18:00:00 America/Los_Angeles'::timestamptz);
```

This is the result:

```output
1 day 01:00:00
```

Notice that it's hybrid: it has both a _days_ component and a _seconds_ component. Now add this _interval_ value to the earlier of the two _timestamptz_ values between which the difference was calculated and compare it with the later of the two _timestamptz_ values between which the difference was calculated:

```plpgsql
select (
    ('2021-03-13 18:00:00 America/Los_Angeles'::timestamptz + '1 day 01:00:00'::interval) =
    ('2021-03-14 20:00:00 America/Los_Angeles'::timestamptz)
  )::text;
```

The result is _false_. In other words, this usual rule of arithmetic doesn't apply:

```output
IF c ◄— a - b  THEN  a ◄— c + b
```

The critical feature of this example  with respect to what seems to be a wrong result is that 18:00 on 13-Mar-2021 in the 'America/Los_Angeles' timezone is _before_ the "spring forward" moment when Daylight Savings Time starts, and that 20:00 and 18:00 on 14-Mar-2021 in that timezone is _after_ the "spring forward" moment.

It's possible to understand, and predict, this outcome (and other hybrid _interval_ arithmetic outcomes like it) by understanding the three different kinds of semantics for the moment-_interval_ overloads of the `+` and `-` operators for pure _mm_ _interval_ values, pure _dd_ _interval_ values, and pure _ss_ _interval_ values.

These rules are explained in the section [The moment-_interval_ overloads of the "+" and "-" operators for _timestamptz_, _timestamp_, and _time_](../moment-interval-overloads-of-plus-and-minus/). The rules for the trickiest case, moment-_interval_ arithmetic using a _pure days interval_ value, are explained in exhaustive detail in the section [Sensitivity of timestamptz-interval arithmetic to the current timezone](../../../../timezones/timezone-sensitive-operations/timestamptz-interval-day-arithmetic/).

However, when you have a hybrid _dd_ and _mm_ _interval_ value, you need also to understand the priority rule: in which order are the different variations of addition/subtraction semantics done?

{{< tip title="Avoid arithmetic that uses hybrid 'interval' semantics." >}}
Yugabyte staff members have discussed this carefully and believe that the attempt to understand and memorize these rules is counterproductive—and therefore foolish. Rather, you should decide which of the three kinds of semantics your application needs and arrange that you produce only pure, rather than hybrid, _interval_ values. Yugabyte recommends, therefore, that  you adopt the practice that the section [Custom domain types for specializing the native _interval_ functionality](../../custom-interval-domains/) explains.

The section _"The moment-interval overloads of the "+" and "-" operators for timestamptz, timestamp, and time"_, [here](../moment-interval-overloads-of-plus-and-minus/#hybrid-interval-arithmetic-is-dangerous) emphasizes the dangers of hybrid _interval_ arithmetic.
