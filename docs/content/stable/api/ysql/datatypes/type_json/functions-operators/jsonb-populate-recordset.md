**Purpose:** Convert a homogeneous JSON _array_ of JSON _objects_ into the equivalent set of SQL _records_.

**Signature** For the `jsonb` variant:

```
input value:       anyelement, jsonb
return value:      SETOF anyelement
```

**Notes:** The functions in this pair and are a natural extension of the functionality of [`jsonb_populate_record()`](../jsonb-populate-record).

Each requires that the supplied JSON value is an _array_, each of whose values is an _object_ which is compatible with the specified SQL `record` which is defined as a `type` whose name is passed via the function's first formal parameter using the locution `NULL:type_identifier`. The JSON value is passed via the second formal parameter. The result is a set (i.e. a table) of `record`s of the specified type.

Use this `ysqlsh` script to create the  type _"t"_, and then to execute the `ASSERT`.

{{< note title="Record and array comparison" >}}
Notice the because the result is a table, it must be materialized in a `cursor for loop`. Each selected row is accumulated in an array of type `t[]`. The expected result is also established in an array of type `t[]`. The input JSON _array_ has been contrived, by sometimes not having a key `"a"` or a key `"b"` so that the resulting records sometimes have `NULL` fields. Record comparison, and array comparison, both use `IS NOT DISTINCT FROM` semanticsâ€”unlike is the case for scalar comparison. This means that the `ASSERT` can use a simple equality test to compare _"rows"_ and _"expected_rows"_. See the section [Operators for comparing two arrays](../../../type_array/functions-operators/comparison/).
