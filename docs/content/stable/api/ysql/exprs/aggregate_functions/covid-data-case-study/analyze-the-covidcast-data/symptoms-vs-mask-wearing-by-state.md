This query:

```plpgsql
select
  round(mask_wearing_pct)  as "% wearing mask",
  round(symptoms_pct)      as "% with symptoms",
  state
from covidcast_fb_survey_results_v
where survey_date = to_date('2020-10-21', 'yyyy-mm-dd')
order by 1;
```

selects out the data for 21-Oct-2020 so that they can be used to draw a scatter-plot. This is the result:

The overall trend is clear: as mask-wearing percent increases, the incidence of COVID-like symptoms decreases.

You can re-run the query for several different arbitrarily selected dates. Or you can calculate the averages per state over the whole observation period like this:

```plpgsql
select
  round(avg(mask_wearing_pct))  as "% wearing mask",
  round(avg(symptoms_pct))      as "% with symptoms",
  state
from covidcast_fb_survey_results_v
group by state
order by 1;
```
The overall trend is always the same.
