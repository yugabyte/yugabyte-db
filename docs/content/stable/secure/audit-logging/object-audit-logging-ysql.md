Object audit logging logs statements that affect a particular relation. Only SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands are supported. TRUNCATE is not included in object audit logging.

Object audit logging is intended to be a finer-grained replacement for `pgaudit.log = 'read, write'`. As such, it may not make sense to use them in conjunction but one possible scenario would be to use session logging to capture each statement and then supplement that with object logging to get more detail about specific relations.

In YugabyteDB, object-level audit logging is implemented by reusing the PG role system. The `pgaudit.role` setting defines the role that will be used for audit logging. A relation ( TABLE, VIEW, etc.) will be audit logged when the audit role has permissions for the command executed or inherits the permissions from another role. This allows you to effectively have multiple audit roles even though there is a single master role in any context.

## Object-level example

In this example, object audit logging is used to illustrate how a granular approach may be taken towards logging of SELECT and DML statements.

### Setup

{{% explore-setup-single %}}

Using ysqlsh, connect to the database and enable the pgaudit extension on the YugabyteDB cluster as follows:

```sql
\c yugabyte yugabyte;
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pgaudit;
```

### Enable object auditing

Set [pgaudit.role](https://github.com/pgaudit/pgaudit/blob/master/README.md#pgauditrole) to `auditor` and grant `SELECT` and `UPDATE` privileges on the `account` table. Any `SELECT` or `UPDATE` statements on the `account` table will now be logged. Note that logging on the `account` table is controlled by column-level permissions, while logging on the `account_role_map` table is table-level.

```sql
CREATE ROLE auditor;

SET pgaudit.role = 'auditor';
```

### Create a table

```sql
CREATE TABLE account
(
    id int,
    name text,
    password text,
    description text
);

GRANT SELECT (password)
   ON public.account
   TO auditor;

SELECT id, name FROM account;

SELECT password FROM account;

GRANT UPDATE (name, password)
   ON public.account
   TO auditor;

UPDATE account
   SET description = 'yada, yada';

UPDATE account
   SET password = 'HASH2';

CREATE TABLE account_role_map
(
    account_id int,
    role_id int
);

GRANT SELECT
   ON public.account_role_map
   TO auditor;

SELECT account.password,
       account_role_map.role_id
  FROM account
       INNER JOIN account_role_map
            ON account.id = account_role_map.account_id;
```

### Verify output

You should see the following output in the logs:
