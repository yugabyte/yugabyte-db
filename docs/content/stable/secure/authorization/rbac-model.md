Role-based access control (RBAC) consists of a collection of permissions on resources given to roles.

## Roles

Roles in YSQL can represent individual users or a group of users. They encapsulate a set of privileges that can be assigned to other roles (or users). Roles are essential to implementing and administering access control on a YugabyteDB cluster. Below are some important points about roles:

* Roles which have `LOGIN` privilege are users. Hence, all users are roles, but not all roles are users.

* Roles can be granted to other roles, making it possible to organize roles into a hierarchy.

* Roles inherit the privileges of all other roles granted to them.

YugabyteDB inherits a number of roles from PostgreSQL, including the `postgres` user, and adds several new roles. View the YugabyteDB-specific roles for your clusters with the following command (or use `\duS` to display all roles):

```sql
yugabyte=> \du
```

```output
                                     List of roles
  Role name   |                         Attributes                         | Member of
--------------+------------------------------------------------------------+-----------
 postgres     | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS | {}
 yb_db_admin  | No inheritance, Cannot login                               | {}
 yb_extension | Cannot login                                               | {}
 yb_fdw       | Cannot login                                               | {}
 yugabyte     | Superuser, Create role, Create DB, Replication, Bypass RLS | {}
```

The following table describes the default YSQL roles and users in YugabyteDB clusters.
<!-- Portions of this table are also under Database authorization in Yugabyte cloud -->

| Role | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| postgres | Superuser role created during database creation. |
| yb_db_admin | Role that allows non-superuser users to create tablespaces and perform other privileged operations. |
| yb_extension | Role that allows non-superuser users to create PostgreSQL extensions. |
| yb_fdw | Role that allows non-superuser users to [CREATE](../../../api/ysql/the-sql-language/statements/ddl_create_foreign_data_wrapper/), [ALTER](../../../api/ysql/the-sql-language/statements/ddl_alter_foreign_data_wrapper/), and [DROP](../../../api/ysql/the-sql-language/statements/ddl_drop_foreign_data_wrapper/) [foreign data wrappers](../../../explore/ysql-language-features/advanced-features/foreign-data-wrappers/). |
| yugabyte | Superuser role used during database creation, by Yugabyte support to perform maintenance operations, and for backups (using ysql_dump). |

### yb_extension

The `yb_extension` role allows non-superuser roles to [create extensions](../../../api/ysql/the-sql-language/statements/ddl_create_extension/). A user granted this role can create all the extensions that are bundled in YugabyteDB.

Create a role `test` and grant `yb_extension` to this role.

```sql
yugabyte=# create role test;
yugabyte=# grant yb_extension to test;
yugabyte=# set role test;
yugabyte=> select * from current_user;
```

```output
 current_user
--------------
 test
(1 row)
```

Create an extension as the test user and check if it's created.

```sql
yugabyte=> create extension pgcrypto;
yugabyte=> select * from pg_extension where extname='pgcrypto';
```

```output
 extname  | extowner | extnamespace | extrelocatable | extversion | extconfig | extcondition
----------+----------+--------------+----------------+------------+-----------+--------------
 pgcrypto |    16386 |         2200 | t              | 1.3        |           |
(1 row)
```

## Resources

YSQL defines a number of specific resources that represent underlying database objects. A resource can represent one object or a collection of objects. YSQL resources are hierarchical as described below:

* Databases and tables follow the hierarchy: `ALL DATABASES` > `DATABASE` > `TABLE`
* ROLES are hierarchical (they can be assigned to other roles). They follow the hierarchy: `ALL ROLES` > `ROLE #1` > `ROLE #2` ...

The table below lists out the various resources.

Resource        | Description |
----------------|-------------|
`DATABASE`      | Denotes one database. Typically includes all the tables and indexes defined in that database. |
`TABLE`         | Denotes one table. Includes all the indexes defined on that table. |
`ROLE`          | Denotes one role. |
`ALL DATABASES` | Collection of all databases in the database. |
`ALL ROLES`     | Collection of all roles in the database. |

## Privileges

Privileges are necessary to execute operations on database objects. Privileges can be granted at any level of the database hierarchy and are inherited downwards. The set of privileges include:

Privilege  | Objects                      | Operations                          |
------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
`ALTER`     | database, table, role        | ALTER                               |
`AUTHORIZE` | database, table, role        | GRANT privilege, REVOKE privilege |
`CREATE`    | database, table, role, index | CREATE                              |
`DROP`      | database, table, role, index | DROP                                |
`MODIFY`    | database, table              | INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE    |
`SELECT`    | database, table              | SELECT                              |

{{< note title="Note" >}}

The `ALTER TABLE` privilege on the base table is required in order to CREATE or DROP indexes on it.
