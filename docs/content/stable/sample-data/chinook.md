The Chinook sample database for a digital media store can be used to explore and learn YugabyteDB.

You can install and use the Chinook sample database using:

- A local installation of YugabyteDB. To install YugabyteDB, refer to [Quick Start](/preview/tutorials/quick-start/).
- Using cloud shell or a client shell to connect to a cluster in YugabyteDB Aeon. Refer to [Connect to clusters in YugabyteDB Aeon](../../yugabyte-cloud/cloud-connect/). To get started with YugabyteDB Aeon, refer to [Quick start](../../yugabyte-cloud/cloud-quickstart/).

In either case, you use the YugabyteDB SQL shell ([ysqlsh](../../api/ysqlsh/)) CLI to interact with YugabyteDB using [YSQL](../../api/ysql/).

## About the Chinook database

The Chinook data model represents a digital media store, including tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

- Media-related data was created using real data from an Apple iTunes library.
- Customer and employee information was created using fictitious names and addresses that can be located on Google maps, and other well formatted data (phone, fax, email, etc.)
- Sales information was auto generated using random data for a four year period.

The Chinook sample database includes:

- 11 tables
- A variety of indexes, primary and foreign key constraints
- Over 15,000 rows of data

For details, here's the entity relationship diagram of the Chinook data model.

## Install the Chinook sample database

The Chinook SQL scripts reside in the `share` folder of your YugabyteDB or client shell installation. They can also be found in the [`sample` directory of the YugabyteDB GitHub repository](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/tree/master/sample). The following files will be used for this exercise:

- [chinook_ddl.sql](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/master/sample/chinook_ddl.sql) — Creates the tables and constraints
- [chinook_genres_artists_albums.sql](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/master/sample/chinook_genres_artists_albums.sql) — Loads artist and album information
- [chinook_songs.sql](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/master/sample/chinook_songs.sql) — Loads individual song information

Follow the steps here to install the Chinook sample database.

### Open the YSQL shell

If you are using a local installation of YugabyteDB, run the `ysqlsh` command from the `yugabyte` root directory.

```sh
$ ./bin/ysqlsh
```

If you are connecting to YugabyteDB Aeon, open the [ysqlsh cloud shell](/preview/yugabyte-cloud/cloud-connect/connect-cloud-shell/), or [run the YSQL connection string](/preview/yugabyte-cloud/cloud-connect/connect-client-shell/) for your cluster.

### Create the Chinook database

To create the `chinook` database, run the following command.

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# CREATE DATABASE chinook;
```

Confirm that you have the `chinook` database by using the `\l` command to list the databases on your cluster.

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# \l
```

Connect to the `chinook` database.

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# \c chinook
```

```output
You are now connected to database "chinook" as user "yugabyte".
chinook=#
```

### Build the tables and objects

To build the tables and database objects, run the following `\i` command.

```plpgsql
chinook=# \i share/chinook_ddl.sql
```

You can verify that all 11 tables have been created by running the `\d` command.

```plpgsql
chinook=# \d
```

### Load the sample data

To load the `chinook` database with sample data, you need to run the SQL scripts.

First, run the SQL script to load the genres, artists, and albums.

```plpgsql
chinook=# \i share/chinook_genres_artists_albums.sql
```

Next, run the SQL script to load the songs.

```plpgsql
chinook=# \i share/chinook_songs.sql
```

Now verify that you have data by running a simple `SELECT` statement to pull some data from the `Track` table.

```plpgsql
chinook=# SELECT "Name", "Composer" FROM "Track" LIMIT 10;
```

```output
              Name               |                          Composer
