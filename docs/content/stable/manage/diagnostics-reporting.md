By default, the [YB-Master](../../reference/configuration/yb-master/) and [YB-TServer](../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/) nodes report cluster diagnostics to the Yugabyte diagnostics service every time a new cluster gets created and every hour thereafter.

No data stored in YugabyteDB or personally identifiable information is collected or reported.

## Data collected

The data collected depends on the collection level. To change the collection level, see [Configure diagnostics collection](#configure-diagnostics-collection).

### Collection level: low

The following data is collected:

- Collection time
- Cluster uuid
- Node uuid
- Node type (tserver or master)
- Number of masters (yb-master processes)
- Number of tablet servers (yb-tserver processes)
- Number of tables
- Number of tablets
- Cluster configuration (gflags)
- Host name (for each node where yb-master and yb-tserver processes are running)
- Username (for each node where yb-master and yb-tserver processes are running)

### Collection level: medium [Default]

In addition to the low-level data, the following data is collected:

- Performance metrics
- RPC metrics

### Collection level: high

Same as `medium` level. No extra information is collected for this level. This level may be used in the future to collect additional diagnostics information such as error logs.

## Example of metrics collected

The following is an example of a payload that is collected:

```output.json
[
    {
        "type": "tablet",
        "id": "eca8b3cfb2ee4eca94dde519634e1e38",
        "attributes": {
            "partition": "hash_split: [16380, 19110)",
            "table_name": "test",
            "table_id": "82f5f7ab81a44923b5f544fbd0664afe"
        },
        "metrics": [
            {
                "name": "log_reader_bytes_read",
                "value": 0
            },
            {
                "name": "log_reader_entries_read",
                "value": 0
            },
            {
                "name": "log_reader_read_batch_latency",
                "total_count": 0,
                "min": 0,
                "mean": 0,
                "percentile_75": 0,
                "percentile_95": 0,
                "percentile_99": 0,
                "percentile_99_9": 0,
                "percentile_99_99": 0,
                "max": 0,
                "total_sum": 0
            }
        ]
    }
]
```

### Example of RPCs collected

```output.json
{
    "inbound_connections": [
        {
            "remote_ip": "10.150.0.20:41134",
            "state": "OPEN",
            "remote_user_credentials": "{real_user=yugabyte, eff_user=}",
            "processed_call_count": 2456
        },
        {
            "remote_ip": "10.150.0.20:54141",
            "state": "OPEN",
            "remote_user_credentials": "{real_user=yugabyte, eff_user=}",
            "processed_call_count": 2471
        }
    ]
}
```

## Configure diagnostics collection

You can add the following configuration flags while starting the [YB-Master](../../reference/configuration/yb-master/) and [YB-TServer](../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/) nodes to configure the diagnostics reporting behavior of YugabyteDB.

| Flag | Default | Description |
|:-----|:--------|:----------- |
| `--callhome_collection_level` | `medium` | Collection level with possible values of `low`, `medium`, or `high`
| `--callhome_interval_secs` | 3600 | Collection interval in seconds
| `--callhome_url ` | `http://diagnostics.yugabyte.com` | Endpoint where diagnostics information is reported.
| `--callhome_enabled` | `true` | Controls whether diagnostics information is collected and reported. Set to `false` to disable collection. |
