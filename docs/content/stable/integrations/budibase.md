[Budibase](https://budibase.com/) is an open-source, low-code platform designed for rapidly building and deploying business applications, especially for those looking to minimize development time and complexity. It allows both technical and non-technical users to create custom software solutions without extensive coding knowledge.

Budibase integrates with other tools and services, making it easier to connect your applications with existing systems and workflows. As YugabyteDB is fully PostgreSQL-compatible, Budibase can connect to YugabyteDB as a PostgreSQL resource.

## Setup

- Set up Budibase using either the [cloud](https://account.budibase.app/) or the [self-hosted options](https://docs.budibase.com/docs/hosting-methods).
- Set up your YugabyteDB cluster by following the instructions at [YugabyteDB Prerequisites](/preview/integrations/tools/#yugabytedb-prerequisites).

## Connect Budibase to YugabyteDB

1. Sign in to Budibase and set up a new application either from scratch via **Create new app** or by choosing one from the existing templates.
1. On the **Data** tab, click on the **+ (plus)** icon to add a new data source.
1. From the list of data sources, select **PostgreSQL**.
1. Enter the [connection parameters](/preview/integrations/tools/#connection-parameters) (host information and database credentials) for your YugabyteDB cluster.

You are all set to use data from YugabyteDB in your Budibase application.
