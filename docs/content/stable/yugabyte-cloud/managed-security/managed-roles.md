YugabyteDB Aeon uses role-based access control (RBAC) to manage access to your YugabyteDB Aeon account. Using roles, you can enforce the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege) (PoLP) by ensuring that users have the precise permissions needed to fulfill their roles while mitigating the risk of unauthorized access or accidental breaches. A role defines a set of permissions that determine what features can be accessed by account users who have been assigned that role.

YugabyteDB Aeon includes [built-in roles](#built-in-roles), and you can [define custom roles](#create-a-role) for team members to restrict access to specific account features. For information on assigning roles to users, refer to [Change a user's role](../manage-access/#change-a-user-s-role).

Roles are also assigned to [API keys](../../managed-automation/managed-apikeys/) to delineate what functionality is available to users accessing your account using either the YugabyteDB Aeon API or CLI. You assign roles to API keys when creating the key; refer to [Create an API key](../../managed-automation/managed-apikeys/#create-an-api-key).

{{< tip title="YugabyteDB Aeon account users are not the same as database users" >}}

Account users and roles are distinct from the users and roles on your YugabyteDB databases. For information on managing database users, refer to [Add database users](../../cloud-secure-clusters/add-users/).

{{< /tip >}}

The **Roles** tab displays a list of roles that are defined for your account, including the role name, description, type, the number of users assigned the role, and the number of API keys created for the role.

## Built-in roles

YugabyteDB Aeon includes built-in roles for managing your account:

- **Admin** - The Admin role provides full access to all features. There must always be at least one Admin user. The primary account user (the user who created the YugabyteDB Aeon account) is automatically assigned an Admin role.

- **Developer** - The Developer role provides access to all features, with the exception of the following administrative tasks:

  - invite users
  - delete or change the role of other users
  - change login methods
  - create or revoke API keys
  - manage plans and billing
  - view account activity

- **Viewer** - The Viewer role has _all_ view permissions, exclusively, and can't perform any tasks.

You can't delete or edit built-in roles.
