Use the **Nodes** tab to review cluster nodes, including their status and activity. The tab displays read/write operations, tablet distribution, memory use, size, and which nodes host [Masters](../../../architecture/key-concepts/#master-server) and [TServers](../../../architecture/key-concepts/#tserver).
