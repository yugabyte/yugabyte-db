Occasionally, you might encounter issues during installation and upgrade of YugabyteDB Anywhere (YBA) using [YBA Installer](../../../install-yugabyte-platform/install-software/installer/).

If you have problems while troubleshooting, contact {{% support-platform %}}.

## Permissions issue with find command

YBA Installer preflight check fails with the following error:

```output
ERROR[2023-12-08T08:25:58Z] Command 'find as user yugabyte' failed with exit code '1' and stderr 'find: Failed to change directory: Permission denied
find: Failed to change directory: Permission denied
find: Failed to change directory: Permission denied
find: Failed to change directory: Permission denied
find: failed to restore initial working directory: Permission denied
```

This happens when the user doesn't have sufficient privileges on the `yba_installer_full` directory where the YBA Installer installation package was untarred.

Affected releases: All

Workaround: Change permissions on `yba_installer_full` directory to 755.

## Preflight check for Prometheus fails

Upgrades fail the preflight check with the following error when run as `yba-ctl preflight --upgrade`:

```output
time=2024-01-03T19:19:04Z level=error msg=preflight prometheus failed: couldn't parse either scrapeInterval: 15 or scrapeTimeout: 10 to duration. check https://pkg.go.dev/time#ParseDuration for appropriate syntax
```

Affected releases: Upgrading from YBA versions earlier than v2.18.5 to v2.18.5 and later using YBA Installer.

Workaround: Ignore this preflight check. YBA Installer automatically converts the invalid settings to valid values and performs the upgrade.

If you want to have green preflight checks prior to the upgrade, change the `scrapeInterval` and `scrapeTimeout` settings in `/opt/yba-ctl/yba-ctl.yml` to `10s` and `15s` respectively.

## New settings are not automatically updated in yba-ctl.yml

When new default settings are added to `yba-ctl.yml` in a newer release, they may not be automatically added to `yba-ctl.yml` of an existing installation after an upgrade.

Affected releases: All

Workaround: If you want to configure the new settings to non-default values, manually add the keys and values to `/opt/yba-ctl/yba-ctl.yml`. Otherwise, no action is needed.

## High availability on Replicated installation with HTTP no longer works after migration

If you have a Replicated installation that uses HTTP and you [migrate to YBA Installer](../../../install-yugabyte-platform/migrate-replicated/), your [high availability](../../../administer-yugabyte-platform/high-availability/) (HA) setup will no longer work after the migration. This is because YBA Installer always uses HTTPS. YBA Installer will attempt to block the migration if it detects a Replicated installation with HA enabled that uses HTTP.

Affected releases: All

Workaround: Refer to [Migration and high availability](../../../install-yugabyte-platform/migrate-replicated/#migration-and-high-availability).

## Running low on free disk space

If you are running out of disk space on your YugabyteDB Anywhere node, check the size of the Prometheus directory (default location is `/opt/yugabyte/data/prometheus`) using the following command:

```sh
du -h -s /opt/yugabyte/data/prometheus/storage
```

If the Prometheus directory is taking up a lot of space, you can reduce its size by changing the retention time and the scrape interval for database metrics.

Affected releases: All

Workaround: Reduce the Prometheus directory size by changing the metrics retention time and scrape interval [configuration options](../../../install-yugabyte-platform/install-software/installer/#prometheus-configuration-options).

Perform the following steps:

1. Reduce the `retentionTime` and increase the `scrapeInterval` configuration options in the `/opt/yba-ctl/yba-ctl.yml` file.
1. Run `yba-ctl reconfigure` to [reconfigure](../../../install-yugabyte-platform/install-software/installer/#reconfigure) your YugabyteDB Anywhere instance with the new settings.
