YugabyteDB Anywhere can automatically create and manage self-signed certificates for universes when you create them. These certificates may be shared between universes in a single instance of YugabyteDB Anywhere.

Automatically generated certificates are named using the following convention:

```sh
yb-environment-universe_name
```

where _environment_ is the environment type (either `dev`, `stg`, `demo`, or `prod`) that was used during the tenant registration (admin user creation), and _universe_name_ is the provided universe name.

YugabyteDB Anywhere generates the root CA certificate, root private key, and node-level certificates (assuming node-to-node or client-to-node encryption is enabled), and then provisions those artifacts to the database nodes any time nodes are created or added to the cluster. The following three files are copied to each node:

1. The root certificate (`ca.cert`).
1. The node certificate (`node.ip_address.crt`).
1. The node private key (`node.ip_address.key`).

YugabyteDB Anywhere retains the root certificate and the root private key for all interactions with the cluster.

To view the certificate details, navigate to **Integrations > Security > Encryption in Transit** and click **Show details**.

## Customize the organization name in self-signed certificates

YugabyteDB Anywhere automatically creates self-signed certificates when you run some workflows, such as create universe. The organization name in certificates is set to `example.com` by default.

If you are using YugabyteDB Anywhere version 2.18.2 or later to manage universes with YugabyteDB version 2.18.2 or later, you can set a custom organization name using the global [runtime configuration](../../../administer-yugabyte-platform/manage-runtime-config/) flag, `yb.tlsCertificate.organizationName`.

Note that, for the change to take effect, you need to set the flag _before_ you run a workflow that generates a self-signed certificate.

Customize the organization name as follows:

1. In YugabyteDB Anywhere, navigate to **Admin** > **Advanced** and select the **Global Configuration** tab.
1. In the **Search** bar, enter `yb.tlsCertificate.organizationName` to view the flag, as per the following illustration:

    ![Custom Organization name](/images/yp/encryption-in-transit/custom-org-name.png)

1. Click **Actions** > **Edit Configuration**, enter a new Config Value, and click **Save**.

## Validate custom organization name

You can verify the organization name by running the following `openssl x509` command:

```sh
openssl x509 -in ca.crt -text
```

```output {hl_lines=[6]}
Certificate:
    Data:
        Version: 3 (0x2)
        Serial Number: 1683277970271 (0x187eb2f7b5f)
        Signature Algorithm: sha256WithRSAEncryption
        Issuer: CN=yb-dev-sb-ybdemo-univ1~2, O=example.com
        Validity
            Not Before: May 5 09:12:50 2023 GMT
            Not After : May 5 09:12:50 2027 GMT
```

Notice that default value is `O=example.com`.

After setting the runtime configuration to a value of your choice, (`org-foo` in this example), you should see output similar to the following:

```sh
openssl x509 -in ca.crt -text -noout
```

```output
