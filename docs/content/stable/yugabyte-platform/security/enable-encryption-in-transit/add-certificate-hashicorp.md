YugabyteDB Anywhere allows you to add an encryption in transit configuration using HashiCorp Vault with a public key infrastructure (PKI) secret engine. This configuration can be used to enable TLS for different clusters and YugabyteDB instances. You can apply this configuration to node-to-node encryption, client-to-node encryption, or both.

## Prerequisites

For the correct configuration, the following criteria must be met:

- HashiCorp Vault is unsealed.
- HashiCorp Vault with the PKI secret engine is configured and enabled.
- HashiCorp Vault URL is accessible by YugabyteDB Anywhere.
- Because HashiCorp Vault is accessed via an authentication token mechanism, a token must be created beforehand while creating a key provider with appropriate permissions.
- HashiCorp Vault needs to be running and always accessible to YugabyteDB Anywhere.
- HashiCorp PKI certificate revocation list (CRL) or CA URLs must be accessible from each node server.
- Appropriate certificates and roles have been created for YugabyteDB Anywhere usage.
- Node servers are able to validate certificates.
- Required permissions have been provided to perform various key management operations.

## Configure HashiCorp Vault

Before you can start configuring HashiCorp Vault, install it on a virtual machine, as per instructions provided in [Install Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/install). The vault can be set up as a multi-node cluster. Ensure that your vault installation meets the following requirements:

- Has transit secret engine enabled.
- Its seal and unseal mechanism is secure and repeatable.
- Its token creation mechanism is repeatable.

You need to configure HashiCorp Vault in order to use it with YugabyteDB Anywhere, as follows:

1. Create a vault configuration file that references your nodes and specifies the address, as follows:

    ```properties
    storage "raft" {
    path  = "./vault/data/"
    node_id = "node1"
    }

    listener "tcp" {
    address   = "127.0.0.1:8200"
    tls_disable = "true"
    }

    api_addr = "http://127.0.0.1:8200"
    cluster_addr = "https://127.0.0.1:8201"
    ui = true
    disable_mlock = true
    default_lease_ttl = "768h"
    max_lease_ttl = "8760h"
    ```

    Replace `127.0.0.1` with the vault web address.

    For additional configuration options, see [Parameters](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/configuration#parameters).

1. Initialize the vault server by following instructions provided in [Operator init](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/commands/operator/init).

1. Allow access to the vault by following instructions provided in [Unsealing](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/concepts/seal#unsealing).

1. Enable the secret engine by executing the following command:

    ```shell
    vault secrets enable pki
    ```

1. Configure the secret engine, as follows:

    - Create a root CA or configure the top-level CA.

    - Optionally, create an intermediate CA chain and sign them.

    - Create an intermediate CA for YugabyteDB, as per the following example:

        ```sh
        export pki=pki
        export pki_int="pki_int"
        export role_i=RoleName
        export ip="s.test.com"

        vault secrets enable -path=$pki_int pki
        vault secrets tune -max-lease-ttl=43800h $pki_int
        vault write $pki_int/intermediate/generate/internal common_name="test.com Intermediate Authority" ttl=43800h -format=json | jq -r '.data.csr' > pki_int.csr

        \# *** dump the output of the preceding command in pki_int.csr

        vault write $pki/root/sign-intermediate csr=@pki_int.csr format=pem_bundle ttl=43800h -format=json | jq -r .data.certificate > i_signed.pem

        \# *** dump the output in i_signed.pem

        vault write $pki_int/intermediate/set-signed certificate=@i_signed.pem
        vault write $pki_int/config/urls issuing_certificates="http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki_int/ca" crl_distribution_points="http://127.0.0.1:8200/v1/pki_int/crl"
        ```

1. Create the vault policy, as per the following example:

    ```properties
    # Enable secrets engine
    path "sys/mounts/*" {
    capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "list"]
    }

    # List enabled secrets engine
    path "sys/mounts" {
    capabilities = ["read", "list"]
    }

    # Work with pki secrets engine
    path "pki*" {
    capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "delete", "list", "sudo"]
    }
    ```

1. Generate a token with appropriate permissions (as per the referenced policy) by executing the following command:

    ```shell
    vault token create -no-default-policy -policy=pki_policy
    ```

    You may also specify the following for your token:

    - `ttl` — Time to live (TTL). If not specified, the default TTL of 32 days is used, which means that the generated token will expire after 32 days.
    - `period` — If specified, the token can be infinitely renewed.

    YugabyteDB Anywhere automatically tries to renew the token every 12 hours after it has passed 70% of its expiry window; as a result, you should set the TTL or period to be greater than 12 hours.

    For more information, refer to [Tokens](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/tokens/tokens) in the Hashicorp documentation.

1. Create a role that maps a name in the vault to a procedure for generating a certificate, as follows:

    ```sh
    vault write <PKI_MOUNT_PATH>/roles/<ROLE_NAME> allow_any_name=true allow_subdomains=true max_ttl="8640h"
    ```

    Credentials are generated against this role.

1. Issue certificates for nodes or a YugabyteDB client:

    - For a node, execute the following:

      ```sh
      vault write <PKI_MOUNT_PATH>/issue/<ROLE_NAME> common_name="<NODE_IP_ADDR>" ip_sans="<NODE_IP_ADDR>" ttl="860h"
      ```

    - For YugabyteDB client, execute the following:

      ```sh
      vault write <PKI_MOUNT_PATH>/issue/<ROLE_NAME> common_name="<CLIENT_DB_USER>"
      ```

## Add HashiCorp Vault-provided certificates

When you create a universe, you can enable TLS using certificates provided by HashiCorp Vault, as follows:

1. Navigate to **Integrations > Security > Encryption in Transit**.

1. Click **Add Certificate** to open the **Add Certificate** dialog.

1. Select **Hashicorp**.

    ![Add Hashicorp certificate](/images/yp/encryption-in-transit/add-hashicorp-cert.png)

1. In the **Config Name** field, enter a meaningful name for your configuration.

1. In the **Vault Address** field, specify a valid URL that includes the port number. The format is `http://0.0.0.0:0000`, which corresponds to `VAULT_HOSTNAME:0000`

1. In the **Secret Token** field, specify the secret token for the vault.

1. In the **Role** field, specify the role used for creating certificates.

1. Optionally, provide the secret engine path on which the PKI is mounted. If you do not supply this information, `pki/` will be used.

1. Click **Add** to make the certificate available.
