The instances created on a cloud provider can be assigned special metadata to help manage, bill or audit the resources. On Amazon Web Services (AWS), they are referred to as
[instance tags](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html). You can create and edit these on the **Universe** dashboard of the Yugabyte Platform console.

The option to set instance tags is currently available only for AWS.

## 1. Create instance tags

During the universe creation step, with an AWS cloud provider, use the Yugabyte Platform console to provide the option to input the instance tags as a map of keys and values as shown below.

User can provide these key-value pairs in any order.

### Templated tags

**Name** is the only key that can have `templated` tags, so it can be made of different parts filled in at run-time to determine node and instance names.

- The parts of the template should be enclosed between `${` and `}`.
- The reserved keywords that can be specified: `universe`, `instance-id`, `zone`, and `region`.
- Templated tag value needs to have `instance-id` at the minimum.
- Order of the parts of template do not matter.

### Check Cloud Provider instances*

Browse to the cloud provider's instances page. In this example, since you are using AWS as the cloud provider, browse to **EC2 -> Running Instances**
in the correct availability zone and search for instances that have `test-tags` in their name. You should see something as follows in the **Tags** tab of those instances.

`yb-server-type` and `launched-by` are reserved names.

## 2. Edit instance tags

The map of instance tags can be changed using the edit universe operation. You can modify, insert, or delete existing instance tags as shown below:

![Edit instance tags](/images/ee/inst-tags-2.png)

These are changes, compared to the input during the create universe:

- `Billing` was modified.
- `MyInfo` was deleted.
- `NewInfo` was added.
- `Department` was not changed.

Note that the **Name** key field cannot be edited.

As before, you can confirm on the cloud provider list of instances that the tags have been updated correctly:
