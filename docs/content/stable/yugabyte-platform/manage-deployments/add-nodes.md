The node can brought back to life on a new backing instance using the **Add Node** option from the **Actions** drop-down list for the `Decommissioned` node. For IaaS, like AWS and GCP, Yugabyte Platform will spawn with the existing node instance type in the correct/existing region and zone of that node. After the end of the operation, the node will have `yb-master` and `yb-tserver` processes running along with some data that is load balanced onto this node and status will be marked as `Live`. Note that the node name is reused and is part of the healthy cluster now.
