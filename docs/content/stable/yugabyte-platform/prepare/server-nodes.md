YugabyteDB is designed to run on bare-metal machines, virtual machines (VMs), and cloud provider instances.

The nodes that YugabyteDB Anywhere deploys for use in a YugabyteDB database cluster need to be provisioned for use with YugabyteDB, including the following:

- Compatible Linux OS.
- Other secondary agents, including the node agent, YB-Controller backup agent, and Prometheus Node Exporter for host metrics export.
- Additional software and packages, such as Python.
