### Highlights

We're excited to announce the Technical Preview of the following powerful new features in YugabyteDB aimed at simplifying operations, enhancing functionality, and improving performance.

**Automatic DDL Replication** {{<tags/feature/tp idea="153">}}

xCluster replication currently requires manual execution of DDL statements on both the source and target clusters to ensure schema consistency.

[Automatic DDL Replication](/stable/deploy/multi-dc/async-replication/async-transactional-setup-automatic/#set-up-automatic-mode-replication) eliminates this complexity by seamlessly replicating YSQL DDL changes from the source to the target without requiring manual intervention. This ensures:

* Effortless schema synchronization across clusters.
* Continuous replication without pauses due to schema mismatches.
* Improved reliability by handling DDL execution automatically.

By automating DDL replication, this feature simplifies database management, reduces operational overhead, and enhances the resilience of xCluster replication.

**Advisory locks** {{<tags/feature/tp idea="812">}}

YugabyteDB's latest release introduces support for [PostgreSQL advisory locks](/stable/explore/transactions/explicit-locking/#advisory-locks), enabling efficient application-level locking mechanisms. These locks allow developers to coordinate concurrent processes without blocking transactions, improving workload management and resource synchronization in distributed environments. For more information on PostgreSQL advisory locks, refer to [Advisory locks](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/explicit-locking.html#ADVISORY-LOCKS) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

**Time-travel Queries** {{<tags/feature/tp idea="1110">}}

YugabyteDB now supports [time-travel queries](/stable/manage/backup-restore/time-travel-query/), allowing users to run queries as if they were executed at a specified point in the past. This capability enables historical data analysis, auditing, and debugging, without requiring separate backups or snapshots, enhancing data visibility in a running database.

**PgVector HNSW Index Support** {{<tags/feature/tp idea="1111">}}

YugabyteDB now supports [HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) indexes](/stable/additional-features/pg-extensions/extension-pgvector/#vector-indexing) via the pgvector extension, enabling efficient approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search for high-dimensional data. This addition expands YugabyteDB's vector indexing capabilities, providing another option alongside existing indexing methods for vector similarity search.

**Upgrade from PostgreSQL 11 to PostgreSQL 15** {{<tags/feature/tp idea="1746">}}

YugabyteDB now supports [in-place zero downtime upgrade](/stable/manage/ysql-major-upgrade-yugabyted/) from a PostgreSQL 11-compatible (v2024.2.2) release to a PostgreSQL 15-compatible (v2.25.1) release. This capability allows PostgreSQL major version upgrades without any downtime or interruption to the application.

### New features

* [PostgreSQL Anonymizer](/stable/additional-features/pg-extensions/extension-pganon/) extension, which masks or replaces personally identifiable information (PII) or commercially sensitive data, is now bundled with YugabyteDB. {{<tags/feature/tp idea="1497">}} <!-- IDEA-1497 -->

* YugabyteDB now supports the ability to compute multivariate statistics using the [CREATE STATISTICS](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-createstatistics.html) command. Part of [PostgreSQL 15](/stable/api/ysql/pg15-features), this feature allows the query planner to use cross-column correlation statistics to generate better query plans. {{<tags/feature/tp>}} {{<issue 13598>}}

### Highlights

We're excited to announce the Technical Preview of two foundational features as part of this release.

**PostgreSQL 15 Support** {{<tags/feature/tp>}}

As part of this release, we have upgraded our PostgreSQL fork from version 11.2 to 15.0, enabling you to leverage the many key capabilities introduced in PostgreSQL between these two versions. This upgrade brings YSQL API support for numerous features, including stored generated columns, foreign keys on partitioned tables, and non-distinct NULLs in unique indexes. It also introduces query execution optimizations like incremental sort and memoization, along with various observability and security enhancements.  For more information, refer to [PostgreSQL 15 features](/stable/api/ysql/pg15-features/).

**Query Diagnostics** {{<tags/feature/tp idea="2078">}}

This feature significantly simplifies tuning poorly performing SQL queries by allowing you to capture and export detailed diagnostic information, including bind variables and constants, pg_stat_statements statistics, schema details, active session history, and execution plans. Refer to [Query diagnostics](/stable/launch-and-manage/monitor-and-alert/query-tuning/query-diagnostics/).

**Active session history** {{<tags/feature/ea idea="830">}}

In addition, the Active Session History, which provides real-time and historical views of system activity, is now enabled by default. For more information, refer to [Active Session History](/stable/explore/observability/active-session-history/).
