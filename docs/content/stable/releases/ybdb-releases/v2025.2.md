### Highlights

**Support pgvector extension - With indexing support** {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1111">}}

Brings AI-native capability by supporting pgvector with indexing, enabling efficient similarity search in vector workloads. Enhances vector search capabilities by introducing [Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) indexing](/stable/additional-features/pg-extensions/extension-pgvector/#vector-indexing), enabling faster and more efficient high-dimensional vector lookups.

<!-- **Automatic transactional xCluster DDL replication** {{<tags/feature/ea idea="153">}}

YugabyteDB now supports seamless replication of YSQL DDL changes across xCluster setups, eliminating the need to manually apply DDLs on both source and target clusters.
For more information, refer to [Automatic DDL replication](/stable/deploy/multi-dc/async-replication/async-transactional-setup-automatic/#set-up-automatic-mode-replication).

**Parallel queries: Enabling PG parallelism for colocated tables** {{<tags/feature/ga idea="577">}}

Improves query performance for colocated tables by allowing PostgreSQL to leverage multiple CPUs, leading to faster query execution times. For more information, refer to [Parallel queries](/stable/additional-features/parallel-query/).

**Optimization for INSERT ON CONFLICT batching** {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1455">}}

Queries using the `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` clause are optimized for efficient execution, with automatic batching applied when multiple statements are executed to improve performance.
For more information, refer to [yb_insert_on_conflict_read_batch_size](/stable/reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#yb-insert-on-conflict-read-batch-size). -->

**Cost-Based Optimizer (CBO)** {{<tags/feature/ga idea="483">}}

The CBO leverages YugabyteDB's distributed storage architecture and advanced query execution optimizations, including query pushdowns, LSM indexes, and batched nested loop joins, to deliver PostgreSQL-like performance.

For instructions on enabling CBO, refer to [Enable cost-based optimizer](/stable/best-practices-operations/ysql-yb-enable-cbo/).

### New features

- [YSQL index consistency checker](/stable/api/ysql/exprs/func_yb_index_check/). yb_index_check() is a built-in utility that helps detect and diagnose index inconsistencies in your database to ensure reliable query results. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="2160">}}

- [Transactional DDL](/stable/explore/transactions/transactional-ddl/). Support to align YSQL DDL semantics with PostgreSQL by allowing DDL statements to execute within the main transaction block. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1677">}}

- Added [CDC Logical Replication support](/stable/additional-features/change-data-capture/using-logical-replication/get-started/) for xCluster feature where both CDC and xCluster can work simultaneously on the same source tables. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="82">}}
