### Highlights

**PostgreSQL features enabled by default on new universes**

For new universes running v2025.2 or later, the following YSQL features are now enabled by default when you deploy using [yugabyted](../../../deploy/manual-deployment/start-yugabyted/), [YugabyteDB Anywhere](../../../yugabyte-platform/create-deployments/create-universe-multi-zone/), or [YugabyteDB Aeon](../../../yugabyte-cloud/cloud-basics/create-clusters/) (coming soon to the Early Access track):

* [Read committed](../../../architecture/transactions/read-committed/)
* [Cost-based optimizer](../../../best-practices-operations/ysql-yb-enable-cbo/)
* [Auto Analyze](../../../additional-features/auto-analyze/)
* [YugabyteDB bitmap scan](../../../reference/configuration/postgresql-compatibility/#yugabytedb-bitmap-scan)
* [Parallel append](../../../additional-features/parallel-query/)

In addition, if you upgrade to v2025.2 and the universe already has cost-based optimizer enabled, the following features are enabled by default:

* Auto Analyze
* YugabyteDB bitmap scan
* Parallel append

Note that, apart from the exceptions noted, upgrading existing universes does not change the defaults for any of these features.

For more information on PostgreSQL features developed in YugabyteDB for enhanced compatibility, refer to [Enhanced PostgreSQL Compatibility Mode](../../../reference/configuration/postgresql-compatibility/).

**Table-level locking for concurrent DDL and DML** {{<tags/feature/ea idea="1114">}}

Added [Table-level locks](/stable/explore/transactions/explicit-locking/#table-level-locks) to support concurrent DDL and DML operations across sessions, improving workload concurrency and reducing conflicts during schema changes.

**Improved time synchronization across nodes** {{<tags/feature/ea idea="1807">}}

Time synchronization across nodes has been enhanced through the use of the [ClockBound](https://github.com/aws/clock-bound) library, which is an open source daemon that allows you to compare timestamps to determine order for events and transactions, independent of an instance's geographic location; it improves clock accuracy by several orders of magnitude.

For more information, refer to [ClockBound](/stable/deploy/manual-deployment/system-config/#configure-clockbound).
