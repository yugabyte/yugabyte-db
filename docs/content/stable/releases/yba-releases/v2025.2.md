### Highlights

We're excited to announce the key features and enhancements in the 2025.2.0.0 release, designed to improve performance, usability, and management of your database environments.


### Known issues

* Before [upgrading from PostgreSQL 11 to PostgreSQL 15](/stable/yugabyte-platform/manage-deployments/ysql-major-upgrade-yba/) for a multi-region universe, or a universe with more than 10,000 tables and indexes, increase the catalog upgrade timeout by setting the YugabyteDB Anywhwere runtime configuration parameter `yb.upgrade.wait_attempts_for_major_catalog_upgrade` to 60 or higher at the Universe scope. This prevents timeout issues during the PostgreSQL 15 catalog upgrade process.

  Refer to [Manage runtime configuration settings](../../../yugabyte-platform/administer-yugabyte-platform/manage-runtime-config/). You must be a Super Admin or Admin to set Universe runtime configuration flags.

* You cannot [upgrade from PostgreSQL 11 to PostgreSQL 15](/stable/yugabyte-platform/manage-deployments/ysql-major-upgrade-yba/) for Kubernetes and OpenShift universes if either YugabyteDB Anywhere or database pods are deployed on different clusters, or if they use different service accounts.


### New features


* [CDC Observability](/stable/yugabyte-platform/alerts-monitoring/cdc-observability/). YugabyteDB Anywhere supports monitoring the status of replication slots when using [PostgreSQL Logical Replication Protocol](/stable/additional-features/change-data-capture/using-logical-replication/) for Change Data Capture (CDC). {{<tags/feature/ga idea="709">}}

* [Azure support for multiple Resource Groups (one per region)](/stable/yugabyte-platform/configure-yugabyte-platform/azure). Added support for Azure configurations with one Azure Resource Group per region (and also one network per Azure Resource Group), a configuration providing better network management and resilience. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1606">}}

* [Non-root installation of YBA](/stable/yugabyte-platform/install-yugabyte-platform/install-software/installer/#non-sudo-installation). You can install YugabyteDB Anywhere as a de-privileged user; a root-privileged user is no longer required.  This reduces friction and security concerns during initial testing, setup, and proof of concepts. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1521">}}

* [Support for LDAP/OIDC groups and custom roles in YugabyteDB Anywhere](/stable/yugabyte-platform/administer-yugabyte-platform/oidc-authentication/#use-oidc-groups-with-yugabytedb-anywhere-roles), enabling you to manage user access and permissions directly from your Identity Provider (IDP) in a scalable and secure way. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1501">}}

* Kubernetes

  * [Kubernetes immutability](/stable/yugabyte-platform/anywhere-automation/yb-kubernetes-operator/).

  * [Kubernetes service endpoint](/stable/yugabyte-platform/create-deployments/create-universe-multi-zone-kubernetes/#create-a-common-load-balancer-service-for-yb-masters-yb-tservers). For single-region universes in Kubernetes, added support for creating a unified service endpoint. This is in addition to the already-supported one service endpoint per availability zone (AZ). {{<tags/feature/ga idea ="1405">}}

  * [ARM processor support for Kubernetes universes](/stable/yugabyte-platform/create-deployments/create-universe-multi-zone-kubernetes/). Added support for running Kubernetes-based universes on ARM CPUs. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1486">}}

* [Connection pooling](/stable/yugabyte-platform/create-deployments/create-universe-multi-zone/#advanced-configuration). Optional server-side connection pooling enables more connections per cluster, more efficient memory usage, and faster first connection (and therefore first query) latencies. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1368" >}}

* [YSQL Audit Logs](/stable/yugabyte-platform/alerts-monitoring/universe-logging). Support for producing and exporting audit logs of PostgreSQL statements (which is often required for compliance with government, financial, or ISO certifications) to a log aggregator. This is based on the pgaudit extension. This is based on the pgaudit extension. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1773">}}. <!--Also IDEA-792-->

* [xCluster Disaster Recovery (DR) – Control-plane support for DDL replication](/stable/yugabyte-platform/back-up-restore-universes/disaster-recovery/), enabling seamless replication of schema changes across clusters in a DR setup. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="2089">}}

* [Automatic YB-Master failover](/stable/yugabyte-platform/manage-deployments/remove-nodes/). If a node with Master process fails unexpectedly (reducing health, but not causing service downtime), YugabyteDB Anywhere now auto-heals the universe by starting a Master process on a suitable surviving node (if one exists). {{<tags/feature/ga idea="22">}}

* [Backups with DDL](/stable/yugabyte-platform/back-up-restore-universes/). Backups succeed even when DDL changes are occurring during the backup process. {{<tags/feature/ea idea="1484">}}

* [Configurable common names for Kubernetes](/stable/yugabyte-platform/security/enable-encryption-in-transit/add-certificate-kubernetes/#configurable-common-names) {{<tags/feature/ga idea="2065">}}. You can configure a custom common name suffix for Kubernetes cert-manager.

* Adjusts [backup directory structure](/stable/yugabyte-platform/back-up-restore-universes/back-up-universe-data/#access-backups-in-storage) to include Universe Name, enhancing multi-tenancy and DB portability. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1888">}}

* [Certify CIS-hardened RHEL 8 and RHEL 9 (x86)](/stable/reference/configuration/operating-systems/#using-cis-hardened-operating-systems) Facilitates running YugabyteDB with a CIS-hardened RHEL 8 and RHEL 9 image, enhancing security measures. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1193">}} <!--Also IDEA-1716-->
