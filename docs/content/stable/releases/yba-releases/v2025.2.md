### Highlights

We're excited to announce the key features and enhancements in the 2025.2.0.0 release, designed to improve performance, usability, and management of your database environments.


### New features

* [CDC Observability](/stable/yugabyte-platform/alerts-monitoring/cdc-observability/). YugabyteDB Anywhere supports monitoring the status of replication slots when using [PostgreSQL Logical Replication Protocol](/stable/additional-features/change-data-capture/using-logical-replication/) for Change Data Capture (CDC). {{<tags/feature/ga idea="709">}}

* [Azure support for multiple Resource Groups (one per region)](/stable/yugabyte-platform/configure-yugabyte-platform/azure). Added support for Azure configurations with one Azure Resource Group per region (and also one network per Azure Resource Group), a configuration providing better network management and resilience. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1606">}}

* [Non-root installation of YBA](/stable/yugabyte-platform/install-yugabyte-platform/install-software/installer/#non-sudo-installation). You can install YugabyteDB Anywhere as a de-privileged user; a root-privileged user is no longer required.  This reduces friction and security concerns during initial testing, setup, and proof of concepts. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1521">}}

* [Support for LDAP/OIDC groups and custom roles in YugabyteDB Anywhere](/stable/yugabyte-platform/administer-yugabyte-platform/oidc-authentication/#use-oidc-groups-with-yugabytedb-anywhere-roles), enabling you to manage user access and permissions directly from your Identity Provider (IDP) in a scalable and secure way. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1501">}}

* Kubernetes

  * [Kubernetes immutability](/stable/yugabyte-platform/create-deployments/create-universe-multi-zone-kubernetes/#deploy-immutable-yb-contoller-ybc). Added support to deploy code via immutable Helm images instead of at runtime, eliminating the use of 'kubectl cp' to push executables into the pod or container. {{<tags/feature/ea idea ="1264">}}

  * [Kubernetes service endpoint](/stable/yugabyte-platform/create-deployments/create-universe-multi-zone-kubernetes/#create-a-common-load-balancer-service-for-yb-masters-yb-tservers). For single-region universes in Kubernetes, added support for creating a unified service endpoint. This is in addition to the already-supported one service endpoint per availability zone (AZ). {{<tags/feature/ga idea ="1405">}}

  * [ARM processor support for Kubernetes universes](/stable/yugabyte-platform/create-deployments/create-universe-multi-zone-kubernetes/). Added support for running Kubernetes-based universes on ARM CPUs. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1486">}}

  * [Configurable common names for Kubernetes](/stable/yugabyte-platform/security/enable-encryption-in-transit/add-certificate-kubernetes/#configurable-common-names) {{<tags/feature/ga idea="2065">}}. You can configure a custom common name suffix for Kubernetes cert-manager.

  * Enables retry for the TLS toggle task in Kubernetes and resolves node task failure for ClientToNode only universes. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1714">}}

* [Connection pooling](/stable/yugabyte-platform/create-deployments/create-universe-multi-zone/#advanced-configuration). Optional server-side connection pooling enables more connections per cluster, more efficient memory usage, and faster first connection (and therefore first query) latencies. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1368" >}}

* [YSQL Audit Logs](/stable/yugabyte-platform/alerts-monitoring/universe-logging). Support for producing and exporting audit logs of PostgreSQL statements (which is often required for compliance with government, financial, or ISO certifications) to a log aggregator. This is based on the pgaudit extension. This is based on the pgaudit extension. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1773">}}. <!--Also IDEA-792-->

* [xCluster Disaster Recovery (DR) – Control-plane support for DDL replication](/stable/yugabyte-platform/back-up-restore-universes/disaster-recovery/), enabling seamless replication of schema changes across clusters in a DR setup. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="2089">}}

* [Automatic YB-Master failover](/stable/yugabyte-platform/manage-deployments/remove-nodes/). If a node with Master process fails unexpectedly (reducing health, but not causing service downtime), YugabyteDB Anywhere now auto-heals the universe by starting a Master process on a suitable surviving node (if one exists). {{<tags/feature/ga idea="22">}}

* [Backups with DDL](/stable/yugabyte-platform/back-up-restore-universes/). Backups succeed even when DDL changes are occurring during the backup process. {{<tags/feature/ea idea="1484">}}

* [Export metrics](/stable/yugabyte-platform/alerts-monitoring/anywhere-export-configuration/#dynatrace). Adds Dynatrace as a metric export sink, custom prefix to all metrics, and validation for telemetry providers. {{<tags/feature/ea idea="441">}}

* [CipherTrust support](/stable/yugabyte-platform/security/create-kms-config/ciphertrust-kms/). You can now use Thales CipherTrust as the Key Management System (KMS) for encryption at rest. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1227">}}

* [Alerts](/stable/yugabyte-platform/alerts-monitoring/alert/). Removes the DB Queue Overflow Alert to reduce customer support calls and enhance user experience. {{<tags/feature/ea idea="905">}}

* Enhances [ClockBound](/stable/yugabyte-platform/create-deployments/create-universe-multi-zone/#configure-clockbound-optional) health checks to include systemd status and log analysis. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="2133">}}

* Adjusts [backup directory structure](/stable/yugabyte-platform/back-up-restore-universes/back-up-universe-data/#access-backups-in-storage) to include Universe Name, enhancing multi-tenancy and DB portability. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1888">}}

* Allows backup authorization for EKS using a [service account](/stable/yugabyte-platform/anywhere-automation/yb-kubernetes-operator/#service-account-for-backup) annotated to each universe pod, eliminating the need for managing short-lived credentials. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1924">}}

* [Backup and restore YBA](/stable/yugabyte-platform/administer-yugabyte-platform/back-up-restore-yba/). Enables configuration of continuous backup from the YugabyteDB Anywhere Admin tab, with the inclusion of a new backup storage config select field and a feature flag for activation. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1429">}}

* [Certify CIS-hardened RHEL 8 and RHEL 9 (x86)](/stable/reference/configuration/operating-systems/#using-cis-hardened-operating-systems) Facilitates running YugabyteDB with a CIS-hardened RHEL 8 and RHEL 9 image, enhancing security measures. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1193">}} <!--Also IDEA-1716-->

* Live migration of universes. Simplifies attach and detach flow by ensuring source and destination platforms are of the same version. {{<tags/feature/tp idea="42">}}

*  Allows dynamic flag validation in YugabyteDB Anywhere when upgrading flags for cloud service provider- and Kubernetes- based universes, using the 'validateFlagValue' RPC. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="2058">}}

* Allows easier customization and local execution of database tasks like software and flag upgrades on on-prem database nodes, making YugabyteDB Anywhere more scalable and debuggable. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="2091">}}

<!-- Adds support for the new 'use_privileges' flag in YB Controller, enabling backup and restore of roles. {{<tags/feature/ea idea="394">}} -->
