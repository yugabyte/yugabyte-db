## Transactions

Transactions are a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. These operations can modify multiple tables or rows. Transactions are important to maintain data integrity when multiple users are modifying the same set of rows across tables. For example, credit and debit transactions in a bank account.

To understand how to use transactions when developing applications, see [Transactions](./transactions/acid-transactions-ysql).

## Text search

YugabyteDB supports advanced text search schemes like similarity search, phonetic search, and full-text search, along with the standard pattern matching using the `LIKE` operator.

To understand build advanced search functionalities into your applications, see [Text search](./text-search/).

## Aggregations

When performing analytical operations on your data, it is common to fetch aggregates like min, max, sum, average, and so on.

To understand how to best use aggregates in your applications, see [Aggregations](./aggregations-ycql).

## Batch operations

Sometimes it's better to batch multiple statements into one request to avoid round trips to the server. In [YSQL](/{{<version>}}/api/ysql), this can be done using [Stored Procedures](/{{<version>}}/explore/ysql-language-features/advanced-features/stored-procedures/), which are not supported in the [YCQL](/{{<version>}}/api/ycql) API.

To understand how to best do batch operations in YCQL, see [Batch operations](./batch-operations-ycql).

## Date and time

Although date and time are common concepts, working with dates and times across various time zones can be quite a challenge.

To understand how to use date and time data types effectively in your applications, see [Date and Time](./date-and-time-ysql).

## Strings and text

Text, string, and character data types are probably some of the most commonly used types when designing a schema. YugabyteDB provides an extensive suite of functionality to format and manipulate text data types.

## Data expiration

Cleaning up old, unwanted data can be a painful task. YugabyteDB supports Time-to-Live (TTL) functionality in the YCQL API which you can use to automatically purge old data and reduce storage costs.

{{<lead link="./ttl-data-expiration-ycql">}}
To understand how to use TTL in your YCQL applications, see [TTL for data expiration](./ttl-data-expiration-ycql).
