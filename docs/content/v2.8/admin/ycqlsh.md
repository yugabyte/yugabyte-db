## Overview

The YCQL shell (`ycqlsh`) provides a CLI for interacting with YugabyteDB using [YCQL](../../api/ycql/).

{{< note title="Note" >}}

Previously named `cqlsh`, the YCQL shell is now named `ycqlsh`. Although the `cqlsh` binary is available in the `bin` directory, it is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

{{< /note >}}

## Download

The YCQL shell (`ycqlsh`) is installed as part of YugabyteDB and is located in the `bin` directory of YugabyteDB home. It is also available for download and install from YugabyteDB's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/yugabyte/cqlsh/releases).

## Example

```sh
./bin/ycqlsh --execute "select cluster_name, data_center, rack from system.local" 127.0.0.1

 cluster_name  | data_center | rack
---------------+-------------+-------
 local cluster | datacenter1 | rack1
```

## Online help

Run `ycqlsh --help` to display the online help.

## Syntax

```sh
ycqlsh [flags] [host [port]]
```

Where

- `host` is the IP address of the host on which [YB-TServer](../../architecture/concepts/universe/#yb-tserver-process) is run. The default is local host at `127.0.0.1`.
- `port` is the TCP port at which YB-TServer listens for YCQL connections. The default is `9042`.

| Flags               | Short Form | Default | Description                                                  |

| `--no-color`        |            |         | Disable color output                                         |
| `--browser`         |            |         | Specify the browser to use for displaying `ycqlsh` help. This can be one of the [supported browser names](https://docs.python.org/2/library/webbrowser.html) (for example, Firefox) or a browser path followed by `%s` (for example, `/usr/bin/google-chrome-stable %s`). |
| `--ssl`             |            |         | Use SSL when connecting to YugabyteDB                       |

## Special commands

In addition to supporting regular YCQL statements, `ycqlsh` also supports the following special commands.

### CONSISTENCY

```sql
CONSISTENCY <consistency level>
```

Sets the consistency level for the read operations that follow. Valid arguments include:

| Consistency Level | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `QUORUM`          | Read the strongly consistent results from the tablet's quorum. The read request will be processed by the tablet leader only. This is the default consistency level. |
| `ONE`             | Read from a follower with relaxed consistency guarantees.    |

To inspect the current consistency level, use `CONSISTENCY` with no arguments.

### SHOW VERSION

Prints the `ycqlsh`, Cassandra, CQL, and native protocol versions in use. Example:

```sql
ycqlsh> SHOW VERSION
```

```output
[ycqlsh 5.0.1 | Cassandra 3.9-SNAPSHOT | CQL spec 3.4.2 | Native protocol v4]
```

### SHOW HOST

Prints the IP address and port of the YB-TServer server that `ycqlsh` is connected to in addition to the cluster name. Example:

```sql
ycqlsh> SHOW HOST
```

```output
Connected to local cluster at 127.0.0.1:9042.
```

### SOURCE

Reads the contents of a file and executes each line as a YCQL statement or special `ycqlsh` command.

```output
SOURCE '<file>'
```

Example usage:

```sql
ycqlsh> SOURCE '/home/yugabyte/commands.cql'

```

### CAPTURE

Begins capturing command output and appending it to a specified file. Output will not be shown at the console while it is captured.

```output
CAPTURE '<file>'
CAPTURE OFF
CAPTURE

```

- The path to the file to be appended to must be given inside a string literal. The path is interpreted relative to the current working directory. The tilde shorthand notation (`~/mydir`) is supported for referring to `$HOME`.
- Only query result output is captured. Errors and output from ycqlsh-only commands will still be shown in the `ycqlsh` session.
- To stop capturing output and show it in the `ycqlsh` session again, use `CAPTURE OFF`.
- To inspect the current capture configuration, use `CAPTURE` with no arguments.

### HELP

Gives information about `ycqlsh` commands. To see available topics, enter `HELP` without any arguments. To see help on a topic, use `HELP <topic>`. Also see the `--browser` argument for controlling what browser is used to display help.

```sql
HELP <topic>

```

### PAGING

Enables paging, disables paging, or sets the page size for read queries. When paging is enabled, only one page of data will be fetched at a time and a prompt will appear to fetch the next page. Generally, it's a good idea to leave paging enabled in an interactive session to avoid fetching and printing large amounts of data at once.

```sql
PAGING ON
PAGING OFF
PAGING <page size in rows>

```

To inspect the current paging setting, use `PAGING` with no arguments.

### EXPAND

Enables or disables vertical printing of rows. Enabling EXPAND is useful when many columns are fetched, or the contents of a single column are large.

```sql
EXPAND ON
EXPAND OFF

```

To inspect the current expand setting, use `EXPAND` with no arguments.

### LOGIN

Authenticate as a specified YugabyteDB user for the current session.

```sql
LOGIN <username> [<password>]

```

### EXIT

Ends the current session and terminates the `ycqlsh` process.

```sql
EXIT
QUIT

```

### CLEAR

Clears the console.

```sql
CLEAR
CLS

```

### DESCRIBE

Prints a description (typically a series of DDL statements) of a schema element or the cluster. This is useful for dumping all or portions of the schema.

```sql
DESCRIBE CLUSTER
DESCRIBE SCHEMA
DESCRIBE KEYSPACES
DESCRIBE KEYSPACE <keyspace name>
DESCRIBE TABLES
DESCRIBE TABLE <table name>
DESCRIBE INDEX <index name>
DESCRIBE TYPES
DESCRIBE TYPE <type name>

```

In any of the commands, `DESC` may be used in place of `DESCRIBE`.

The `DESCRIBE CLUSTER` command prints the cluster namer:

```sql
ycqlsh> DESCRIBE CLUSTER

```

```output
Cluster: local cluster

```

The `DESCRIBE SCHEMA` command prints the DDL statements needed to recreate the entire schema. This is especially useful for dumping the schema in order to clone a cluster or restore from a backup.

### COPY TO

Copies data from a table to a CSV file.

```sql
COPY <table name> [(<column>, ...)] TO <file name> WITH <copy flag> [AND <copy flag> ...]

```

If no columns are specified, all columns from the table will be copied to the CSV file. A subset of columns to copy may be specified by adding a comma-separated list of column names surrounded by parenthesis after the table name.

The `file name` should be a string literal (with single quotes) representing a path to the destination file. This can also the special value `STDOUT` (without single quotes) to print the CSV to stdout.

| Flags                    | Default | Description                                                  |

The following flags are common to both `COPY TO` and `COPY FROM`.

| Flags             | Default      | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |

| `THOUSANDSSEP`    |              | The character that is used to separate thousands. Defaults to the empty string. |
| `BOOLSTYlE`       | `True,False` | The string literal format for boolean values.                |
| `NUMPROCESSES`    |              | The number of child worker processes to create for `COPY` tasks. Defaults to a max of 4 for `COPY FROM` and 16 for `COPY TO`. However, at most (num_cores - 1) processes will be created. |
| `MAXATTEMPTS`     | 5            | The maximum number of failed attempts to fetch a range of data (when using `COPY TO`) or insert a chunk of data (when using `COPY FROM`) before giving up. |
| `REPORTFREQUENCY` | 0.25         | How often status updates are refreshed, in seconds.          |
| `RATEFILE`        |              | An optional file to output rate statistics to. By default, statistics are not output to a file. |

### COPY FROM

Copies data from a CSV file to table.

```sql
COPY <table name> [(<column>, ...)] FROM <file name> WITH <copy flag> [AND <copy flag> ...]

```

If no columns are specified, all columns from the CSV file will be copied to the table. A subset of columns to copy may be specified by adding a comma-separated list of column names surrounded by parenthesis after the table name.

The `file name` should be a string literal (with single quotes) representing a path to the source file. This can also the special value `STDIN` (without single quotes) to read the CSV data from stdin.

| Flags             | Default | Description                                                  |
