Use the [Hasura GraphQL Engine](https://hasura.io) with YugabyteDB to power your GraphQL applications with a distributed SQL database.

Follow the steps below to begin using Hasura with YugabyteDB. For details on using Hasura, see the [Hasura GraphQL engine documentation](https://docs.hasura.io).

## Before you begin

### Install and start YugabyteDB

You can be up and running with YugabyteDB in under five minutes by following the steps in [Quick start](../../../quick-start/).

If you're using `yb-ctl` to start your cluster, you can add the option like this:

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-ctl start --tserver_flags "ysql_suppress_unsupported_error=true"
```

PostgreSQL-compatible YSQL API is now available to serve application client requests at `localhost:5433`.

### Install and start Hasura

To install the Hasura GraphQL engine on an existing PostgreSQL database, follow the steps in the Hasura [Quick start with Docker](https://hasura.io/docs/1.0/graphql/manual/deployment/docker/index.html).

To use Hasura with YugabyteDB, the configuration should be similar to PostgreSQL, except that the port should be `5433`.

For a local Mac setup, the configuration should be:

```sh
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 \
  -e HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:@host.docker.internal:5433/yugabyte \
  -e HASURA_GRAPHQL_ENABLE_CONSOLE=true \
  hasura/graphql-engine:v1.1.0
```

{{< note title="Note" >}}

- v1.1.0 refers to the version of `hasura/graphql-engine` we are using, you can change it to a different version as per your needs.
- `@host.docker.internal:5433` is a directive to Hasura to connect to the 5433 port of the host that is running the Hasura container.

## Create sample tables and relationships

Follow the steps below to add tables to the `yugabyte` database specified in the configuration above.
You can use another database, if you want, but make sure to change the database name in the `HASURA_GRAPHQL_DATABASE_URL` setting.

To perform the steps below, open the Hasura UI on http://localhost:8080 and go to the `DATA` tab as shown here.

![DATA tab in Hasura UI](/images/develop/graphql/hasura/data-tab.png)

### 1. Create the `author` table

Click **Create Table** and fill in the details as below to create a table `author(id, name)`.

![author table form](/images/develop/graphql/hasura/author-table.png)

After filling in details, click **Add Table** at the bottom, then go back to the **DATA** tab.

### 2. Create the `article` table

Click **Create Table** again to create a table `article(id, title, content, rating, author_id)`, with a foreign key reference to `author`.

Fill in the details as shown here.

![article table form](/images/develop/graphql/hasura/article-table.png)

Under **Foreign Keys**, click **Add a foreign key** and fill in as shown here.

![foreign keys form](/images/develop/graphql/hasura/foreign-keys.png)

After completing the entries, click **Save** for the foreign key constraint, and then click **Add Table** at the bottom. Then go back to the **DATA** tab.

### 3. Create an object relationship

1. Go to the article table on the left-side menu, then click the **Relationships** tab.

2. Click **Add**, and then click **Save**.

### 4. Create an array relationship

Now go to the author table's **Relationship** tab.

![array relationships form](/images/develop/graphql/hasura/relationship-array.png)

Click **Add**, and then click **Save**.

### 5. Load sample data

1. On the command line, change your directory to the root `yugabyte` directory, and then open `ysqlsh` (the YSQL CLI) to connect to the YugabyteDB cluster:

```sh
$ ./bin/ysqlsh
```

1. Copy the YSQL statements below into the shell and press **Enter**.

```postgresql
INSERT INTO author(name) VALUES ('John Doe'), ('Jane Doe'); 
INSERT INTO article(title, content, rating, author_id) 
VALUES ('Jane''s First Book', 'Lorem ipsum', 10, 2);
INSERT INTO article(title, content, rating, author_id) 
VALUES ('John''s First Book', 'dolor sit amet', 8, 1);
INSERT INTO article(title, content, rating, author_id) 
VALUES ('Jane''s Second Book', 'consectetur adipiscing elit', 7, 2);
INSERT INTO article(title, content, rating, author_id) 
VALUES ('Jane''s Third Book', 'sed do eiusmod tempor', 8, 2);
INSERT INTO article(title, content, rating, author_id) 
VALUES ('John''s Second Book', 'incididunt ut labore', 9, 1);
SELECT * FROM author ORDER BY id;
SELECT * FROM article ORDER BY id;
```

## Run some GraphQL queries

Go back to the Hasura UI and click **GRAPHIQL**.

### Query using the object relationship

Fetch a list of articles and sort each article’s author in descending order and by rating.

```graphql
{
  article(order_by: {rating: desc}) {
    id
    title
    author {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```

![Relationships form](/images/develop/graphql/hasura/query-relationship-object.png)

### Query using the array relationship

Fetch a list of authors and a nested list of each author’s articles where the authors are ordered by descending by the average ratings of their articles, and their article lists are ordered by title.

 ```graphql
 {
   author(order_by: {articles_aggregate: {avg: {rating: desc}}}) {
     name
     articles(order_by: {title: asc}) {
       title
       content
       rating
     }
   }
 }
 ```

## Clean up

Now that you're done with this exploration, you can clean up the pieces for your next adventure.

1. Stop the YugabyteDB cluster by running the `yb-ctl stop` command.

    ```sh
    ./bin/yb-ctl stop
    ```

    Note: To completely remove all YugabyteDB data/cluster-state you can instead run:

    ```sh
    ./bin/yb-ctl destroy
    ```

2. Stop The Hasura container,

    ```sh
    docker stop <container-id>
    ```

    You can list running containers using the following command:

    ```sh
    docker ps
    ```
