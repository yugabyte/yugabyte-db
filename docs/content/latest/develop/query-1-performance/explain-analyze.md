This section describes how to optimize queries using YSQL's `EXPLAIN` and `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` statements.

## The EXPLAIN Statement

Using the `EXPLAIN` statement, you can obtain the query execution plan generated by YSQL for a given SQL statement. In addition to the plan, `EXPLAIN` returns the following information: 

- The so-called startup cost that represents the estimated query cost before the first row is returned.
- The total cost to run the query to completion.

You can use the `EXPLAIN` statement in conjunction with `SELECT`, `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `REPLACE`, and `UPDATE` statements. The `EXPLAIN` statement has the following syntax:

```sql
EXPLAIN [ ( option [, ...] ) ] sql_statement;
```

The *option* and its values are described in the following table. The most important option is `ANALYZE`.

| Option  | Value                           | Description                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ANALYZE | boolean                         | Returns additional run-time statistics, such as time spent within each plan node, number of processed rows, and so on, by executing *sql_statement* (as opposed to just creating the plan, as EXPLAIN without ANALYZE does).</br> The output of *sql_statement* is discarded.</br>To perform analysis of any data-modifying statement (such as INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE) without affecting the data, you must wrap EXPLAIN ANALYZE in a transaction using the following syntax:<br/>BEGIN;<br/>EXPLAIN ANALYZE *sql_statement*;<br/>ROLLBACK; |
| VERBOSE | boolean                         | Displays detailed information about the query plan. <br/>The default value is FALSE. |
| COSTS   | boolean                         | Provides the estimated initial and total costs of each plan node. In addition, estimates the number of rows and the width of each row in the query plan.<br/>The default value is TRUE. |
| BUFFERS | boolean                         | Provides information about the most input-output intensive parts of the query. <br/>The default value is FALSE. <br/>You can only use this option when ANALYZE is set to TRUE. |
| TIMING  | boolean                         | Provides information about the actual startup time and the time spent in each node of the output. <br/>The default value is TRUE. <br/>You can only use this option when ANALYZE is set to TRUE. |
| SUMMARY | boolean                         | Provides additional information, such as the total time after the query plan. The value of this option is TRUE when ANALYZE is set to TRUE. |
| FORMAT  | { TEXT \| XML \| JSON \| YAML } | Allows you to define the query plan output format. <br/>The default value is TEXT. |

### Examples

Typically, you start by creating a table in YugabyteDB and inserting rows into it. 

To create a table called `employees`, execute the following:

```sql
yugabyte=# CREATE TABLE employees(k1 int, k2 int, v1 int, v2 text, PRIMARY KEY (k1, k2));
```

To insert table rows, execute the following:

```sql
yugabyte=# INSERT INTO employees(k1, k2, v1, v2) VALUES (1, 2.0, 3, 'a'), (2, 3.0, 4, 'b'), (3, 4.0, 5, 'c');
```

To check the query plan for simple select, execute the following:

```sql
yugabyte=# EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE k1 = 1;
```

The following output displays the query execution cost estimate:

```
QUERY PLAN
----------------------------------------------------------------
Foreign Scan on employees  (cost=0.00..112.50 rows=1000 width=44)
(1 row)
```

To check the execution plan for select with a complex condition that requires filtering, execute the following:

```sql
yugabyte=# EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees WHERE k1 = 2 and floor(k2 + 1.5) = v1;
```

The following output displays the cost estimate based on the filtered result:

```
QUERY PLAN
----------------------------------------------------------------
Foreign Scan on employees  (cost=0.00..125.00 rows=1000 width=44)
   Filter: (floor(((k2)::numeric + 1.5)) = (v1)::numeric)
(2 rows)
```

By enabling the `ANALYZE` option and wrapping it to preserve data integrity, you can trigger the query execution, as follows:

```sql
BEGIN;
yugabyte=# EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM employees WHERE k1 = 2 and floor(k2 + 1.5) = v1;
ROLLBACK;
```

In addition to the cost estimates from the query planner, `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` displays the server output produced during the statement execution, as shown in the following example:

```sql
yugabyte=# EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM employees a LEFT JOIN LATERAL (SELECT * FROM employees b WHERE a.a = b.a) c ON TRUE;
                                 QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hash Left Join (cost=112.50..390.00 rows=5000 width=8) (actual time=3.939..6.195 rows=100 loops=1)
   Hash Cond: (a.a = b.a)
   ->  Seq Scan on employees a (cost=0.00..100.00 rows=1000 width=4) (actual time=0.568..2.798 rows=100 loops=1)
   ->  Hash  (cost=100.00..100.00 rows=1000 width=4) (actual time=3.363..3.363 rows=100 loops=1)
         Buckets: 1024  Batches: 1  Memory Usage: 12kB
         ->  Seq Scan on employees b (cost=0.00..100.00 rows=1000 width=4) (actual time=0.458..3.339 rows=100 loops=1)
 Planning Time: 0.939 ms
 Execution Time: 7.089 ms
(8 rows)
```

The server output from the preceding example includes the number of rescans (loops) each node performed, the number of milliseconds passed before the first row was returned, total time before the last tuple was returned by each execution node, and the number of tuples returned by each execution node.

`EXPLAIN`, on the other hand,  does not provide this additional information, as shown in the following examples:

```sql
yugabyte=# EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM employees a LEFT JOIN LATERAL (SELECT * FROM employees b WHERE a.a = b.a) c ON TRUE;
                              QUERY PLAN
----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hash Left Join (cost=112.50..390.00 rows=5000 width=8)
   Hash Cond: (a.a = b.a)
   ->  Seq Scan on employees a (cost=0.00..100.00 rows=1000 width=4)
   ->  Hash (cost=100.00..100.00 rows=1000 width=4)
         ->  Seq Scan on employees b (cost=0.00..100.00 rows=1000 width=4)
(5 rows)
```
