1. [Connect a Spring application](connect-application/)
    \
    Connect a Spring Data YugabyteDB application to a Yugabyte Cloud cluster.

## Monitor and manage clusters

Yugabyte Cloud also provides tools to monitor cluster performance and activity, and manage clusters, including scaling and backing up clusters. 

- [Monitor clusters](../cloud-monitor/)
    \
    View performance metrics, live and slow queries, cluster activity, node status, and tables.
- [Manage clusters](../cloud-clusters/)
    \
    Scale and back up and restore clusters.

<!-- 
- [Monitor activity](../cloud-clusters/monitor-activity)
    \
    Review cluster activity.

[Configure alerts](../cloud-admin/alerts/)
    \
    Set up performance- and resource use-based alerts.
