This section will describe how to use the Yugabyte Platform to back up and restore data in YCQL tables.

## Create universe

First, create a universe similar to the steps shown in [Create universe](../create-universe-multi-zone).
For the purposes of this demo we create a one-node cluster that looks something like this.

Wait for the universe to become ready.

## Set storage for backup

### Local storage

In this example, you create a local directory on the tserver to back up to. Select the
**Connect** modal in the **Nodes** tab of the universe and select the server from Admin Host.

Once you are connected using `ssh`, create a directory `/backup` and change the owner to `yugabyte`.

```sh
$ sudo mkdir /backup; sudo chown yugabyte /backup
```

Note that when you have more than one node, an `nfs` mounted on each server is recommended, and
creating a local backup folder on each server will not work.

### AWS cloud storage

You can also back up to Amazon cloud using the `amazon S3` tab in Backup configuration.

The Access Key & Secret text can be added for the IAM of the user. The destination S3 Bucket where backups are
stored can be entered in the format shown in the sample above.

## Back up data

Now, select **Configuration** on the left panel, select the **Backup** tab on top, click **NFS** and then enter
`/backup` as the NFS Storage Path before selecting **Save**.

Now, go to the **Backups** tab and then click **Create Backup**. A modal should appear where you can
enter the table (this demo uses the default redis table) and NFS Storage option. If S3 was selected
as the storage, the **S3 Storage** dropdown option can be chosen during this backup creation.

Select `OK`. If you refresh the page, you'll eventually see a completed task.

## Restore data

On that same completed task, click on the **Actions** dropdown and click **Restore Backup**.
You will see a modal where you can select the universe, keyspace, and table you want to restore to. Enter in
values like this (making sure to change the table name you restore to) and click **OK**.

If you now go to the **Tasks** tab, you will eventually see a completed **Restore Backup** task. To
confirm this worked, go to the **Tables** tab to see both the original table and the table you
restored to.
