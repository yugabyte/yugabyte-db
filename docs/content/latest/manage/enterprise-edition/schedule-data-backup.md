4. Enter the **Backup frequency** (an interval in in milliseconds) or enter a `cron` expression.
5. Select the **Storage** option.
6. Select the **Table keyspace**.
7. In the **Tables to backup** field, select specific tables or the **Full Universe Backup** option.
8. Click **OK** to create the schedule. The first backup will begin immediately and then subsequent backups will be created based on the backup frequency.

## Disable a scheduled backup

If required, you can temporarily disable scheduled backups by going to the **Tables** tab in a universe and click **Disable Backups**.

## Delete a schedule

If you need to remove a scheduled backup, go to the **Backups** tab for your universe and for the scheduled backup, click **Options** and then click **Delete schedule**. The scheduled backup is deleted.
