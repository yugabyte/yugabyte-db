To delete a universe, in the YugabyteDB Admin Console, select **Delete Universe** from the **More** drop-down on the **Universe Detail** page. For public clouds, such as AWS and Google Cloud Platform, the underlying compute instances are terminated after the database has been installed from those nodes. For on-premises data centers, the underlying compute instances are no longer marked as `In Use` which then opens those instances up to be used in new universes.
