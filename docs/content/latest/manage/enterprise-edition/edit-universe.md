Expanding the universe to add more nodes as well as shrinking the universe to lesser number of nodes is as simple as clicking **Edit** on the **Universe** page and then providing the new user intent for the universe. The new user intent can even be for an entirely new configuration of nodes powered by a different instance type. The YugaWare Admin Console will orchestrate this change through the YB-Masters powering this universe. These YB-Masters ensure that the new nodes start hosting the tablet leaders for a set of tablets in such a way that the tablet leader count remains evenly balanced across all the available nodes. This background data replication is undertaken in a throttled manner so that the foreground applications are never impacted.
