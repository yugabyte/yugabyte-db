* YugabyteDB's synchronous replication architecture is inspired by <a href="https://research.google.com/archive/spanner-osdi2012.pdf">Google Spanner</a>.
* YugabyteDB xCluster replication architecture is inspired by RDBMS databases such as Oracle, MySQL and PostgreSQL.

This section describes how replication works in DocDB. The data in a DocDB table is split into tablets. By default, each tablet is synchronously replicated using the Raft algorithm across various nodes or fault domains (such as availability zones/racks/regions/cloud providers).

There are other advanced replication features in YugabyteDB. These include two forms of asynchronous replication of data:

* **xCluster replication** Data is asynchronously replicated between different YugabyteDB clusters - both unidirectional replication (master-slave) or  bidirectional replication across two clusters.
* **Read replicas** The in-cluster asynchronous replicas are called read replicas.
