**Purpose:** Provide the identical functionality to the [`#>`](../subvalue-operators/) operator.

**Signature** For the `jsonb` variant:

```
input value:       jsonb, VARIADIC text
return value:      jsonb
```

The invocation of [`#>`](../subvalue-operators/) can be mechanically transformed to use `jsonb_extract_path()` by these steps:

- Add the function invocation with its required parentheses.
- Replace `#>` with a comma.
- Write the path as a comma-separated list of terms, where both integer array indexes and key-value keys are presented as `text` values, taking advantage of the fact that the function is variadic).

This `DO` block shows the invocation of `#>` and `jsonb_extract_path()` vertically to help visual comparison.

```
do $body$
declare
  j constant jsonb :=
    '[1, {"x": [1, true, {"a": "cat", "b": "dog"}, 3.14159], "y": true}, 42]';

  jsub_1 constant jsonb :=                    j #> array['1', 'x', '2', 'b'];
  jsub_2 constant jsonb := jsonb_extract_path(j,         '1', 'x', '2', 'b');

  expected_jsub constant jsonb := '"dog"';
begin
  assert
    (jsub_1 = expected_jsub) and
    (jsub_2 = expected_jsub),
  'unexpected';
end;
$body$;
```

Notice that even though `jsonb_extract_path()`is variadic, each step that defines the path must be presented as a convertible SQL `text`, even when its meaning is a properly expressed by a SQL `integer`.

The function form is more verbose than the operator form. Moreover, the fact that the function is variadic makes it impossible to invoke it statically (in PL/pgSQL code) when the path length isn't known until run time. There is, therefore, no reason to prefer the function form to the operator form.
