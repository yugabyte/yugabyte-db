Before trying the code in this section, make sure that you have created the _"edges"_ table (see [`cr-edges.sql`](../graph-representation/#cr-edges-sql)) and installed all the code shown in the section [Common code for traversing all kinds of graph](../common-code/).

Start by defining an example undirected cyclic graph and by computing all the paths from a selected start node:

```plpgsql
delete from edges;
alter table edges drop constraint if exists edges_chk cascade;
alter table edges add constraint edges_chk check(node_1 <> node_2);

insert into edges(node_1, node_2) values
  ('n01', 'n02'),
  ('n02', 'n03'),
  ('n03', 'n04'),
  ('n04', 'n05'),
  ('n05', 'n06'),
  ('n06', 'n07'),
  ('n07', 'n08'),

  ('n01', 'n09'),
  ('n09', 'n05'),
  ('n05', 'n10'),
  ('n10', 'n08');

-- Implement the denormalization.
insert into edges(node_1, node_2)
select node_2 as node_1, node_1 as node_2
from edges;
```

Re-create the simpler implementation of _"find_paths()"_ that implements the cycle prevention code, shown at [`cr-find-paths-with-nocycle-check.sql`](../undirected-cyclic-graph/#cr-find-paths-with-nocycle-check-sql). Now generate the paths that start at the node _"n01"_, restrict these to just the shortest paths, and restrict these further to the set of longest unique containing paths:

```plpgsql
call find_paths(start_node => 'n01');
call restrict_to_shortest_paths('raw_paths', 'temp_paths');
call restrict_to_unq_containing_paths('temp_paths', 'unq_containing_paths');
\t on
select t from list_paths('unq_containing_paths');
\t off
```

This is the result:

```output
 path #   cardinality   path
 ------   -----------   ----
      1             4   n01 > n02 > n03 > n04
      2             5   n01 > n09 > n05 > n06 > n07
      3             5   n01 > n09 > n05 > n10 > n08
```

These are the unique containing paths of the shortest paths from the raw paths. Here they are. The pictures are numbered with the value assigned by [`row_number()`](../../../../exprs/window_functions/function-syntax-semantics/row-number-rank-dense-rank/#row-number) (see the implementation of _["list_paths()"](../common-code/#cr-list-paths-sql)_):

For contrast, do this:

```plpgsql
call restrict_to_unq_containing_paths('raw_paths', 'temp_paths');
call restrict_to_longest_paths('temp_paths', 'unq_containing_paths');
\t on
select t from list_paths('unq_containing_paths');
\t off
```

This is the result:

```output
 path #   cardinality   path
 ------   -----------   ----
      1             6   n01 > n02 > n03 > n04 > n05 > n09
      2             6   n01 > n09 > n05 > n04 > n03 > n02
      3             9   n01 > n02 > n03 > n04 > n05 > n06 > n07 > n08 > n10
      4             9   n01 > n02 > n03 > n04 > n05 > n10 > n08 > n07 > n06
```

These are longest paths from the unique containing paths of the raw paths. Here they are. The pictures are again numbered with the value assigned by `row_number()`.

![unq-containing-paths-2](/images/api/ysql/the-sql-language/with-clause/traversing-general-graphs/unq-containing-paths-2.jpg)

These two pictures together provide a very compact way to understand the meaning of the set of twenty-six distinct raw paths produced by `call find_paths(start_node=>'n01')`.
