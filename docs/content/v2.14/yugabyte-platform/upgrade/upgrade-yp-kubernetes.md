You can use [Helm](https://helm.sh/) to upgrade your YugabyteDB Anywhere installed on [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to a newer version.

Before running an upgrade, execute the following command to obtain the latest versions of YugabyteDB Anywhere from Helm charts:

```sh
helm repo update
```

To upgrade to a specific version while preserving overrides you might have applied to your initial YugabyteDB Anywhere installation or previous upgrades, execute the following command:

```sh
helm upgrade yw-test yugabytedb/yugaware --version {{<yb-version version="v2.14" format="short">}} -n yb-platform --reset-then-reuse-values --set image.tag={{<yb-version version="v2.14" format="build">}} --wait
```

If you do not wish to port your overrides, do not include `--reset-then-reuse-values`. Instead, you may choose to pass your existing overrides file by adding `--values custom-values.yaml` to your command during the upgrade.
