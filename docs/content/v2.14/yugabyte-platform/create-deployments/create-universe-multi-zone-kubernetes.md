YugabyteDB Anywhere allows you to create a universe in one geographic region across multiple availability zones using Kubernetes as a cloud provider.

## Prerequisites

Before you start creating a universe, ensure that you performed steps described in [Configure the Kubernetes cloud provider](/preview/yugabyte-platform/configure-yugabyte-platform/set-up-cloud-provider/kubernetes/). The following illustration shows the **Managed Kubernetes Service configs** list that you should be able to see if you use YugabyteDB Anywhere to navigate to **Configs > Cloud Provider Configuration > Infrastructure > Managed Kubernetes Service**:

Note that the cloud provider example used in this document has a cluster-level admin access.

## Create a universe

If no universes have been created yet, the **Dashboard** does not display any.

To start, click **Create Universe** and complete the first two fields of the **Cloud Configuration** section:

- In the **Name** field, enter the name for the YugabyteDB universe (for example, yb-k8s).

- Use the **Provider** field to select the appropriate Kubernetes cloud (for example, K8s Provider). Notice that additional fields appear.

Complete the rest of the **Cloud Configuration** section as follows:

- Use the **Region** field to select the region. This enables the **Availability Zones** option that allows you to see zones belonging to that region.

- Provide the value in the **Nodes** field. This value should be equal to or greater than the replication factor. The default value is 3. When this value is supplied, the nodes are automatically placed across all the availability zones to guarantee the maximum availability.

- In the **Replication Factor** field, define the replication factor, as per the following illustration:

Complete the **Instance Configuration** section as follows:

- Use the **Instance Type** field to select the CPU and memory combination, as per needs to allocate the YB-TServer nodes. The default is small. You can override this setting when you configure the Kubernetes cloud provider (see [Configuring the region and zones](/preview/yugabyte-platform/configure-yugabyte-platform/set-up-cloud-provider/kubernetes/#configure-region-and-zones)).
- In the **Volume Info** field, specify the number of volumes multiplied by size. The default is 1 x 100GB.
- Select **Enable YSQL** to enable the YSQL API endpoint to run Postgres-compatible workloads. This setting is enabled by default.
- Select **Enable YEDIS** to enable the YEDIS API endpoint to run Redis-compatible workloads. This setting is disabled by default.
- Select **Enable Node-to-Node TLS** to enable encryption-in-transit for communication between the database servers. This setting is enabled by default.
- Select **Enable Client-to-Node TLS** to enable encryption-in-transit for communication between clients and the database servers. This setting is enabled by default.
- Select **Enable Encryption at Rest** to enable encryption for data stored on the tablet servers. This setting is disabled by default.

Complete the **Advanced** section as follows:

- In the **DB Version** field, specify the YugabyteDB version. The default is either the same as the YugabyteDB Anywhere version or the latest YugabyteDB version available for YugabyteDB Anywhere.

Complete the **G-Flags** section as follows:

- Click **Add Flags > Add to Master** to specify YugabyteDB Masters parameters, one parameter per field.

- Click **Add Flags > Add to T-Server** to specify the YugabyteDB T-Servers parameters, one parameter per field.

  For details, see the following:

  - [Edit configuration flags](/preview/yugabyte-platform/manage-deployments/edit-config-flags)

  - [YB Master Configuration Flags](/preview/reference/configuration/yb-master/#configuration-flags)

  - [YB T-Server Configuration Flags](/preview/reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#configuration-flags)

Accept default values for all of the remaining fields.

The final step is to click **Create** and wait for the YugabyteDB cluster to appear.

The following illustration shows the universe in its pending state:

## Examine the universe and connect to nodes

The universe view consists of several tabs that provide different information about this universe.

The following illustration shows the **Overview** tab of a newly-created universe:

The following illustration shows the **Nodes** tab that allows you to see a list of nodes with their addresses:

![img](/images/yb-platform/kubernetes-config12.png)

You can create a connection to a node as follows:

- Click **Connect** to access the information about the universe's endpoints to which to connect.

- On a specific node, click **Actions > Connect** to access the `kubectl` commands that you need to copy and use to connect to the node.

## Connect to the universe

For information on how to connect to the universe from the Kubernetes cluster, as well as remotely, see [Connecting YugabyteDB clusters](/preview/deploy/kubernetes/clients/#connecting-tls-secured-yugabytedb-cluster-deployed-by-helm-charts).
