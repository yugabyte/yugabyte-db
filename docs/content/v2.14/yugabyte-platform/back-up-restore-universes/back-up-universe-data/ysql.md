You can use YugabyteDB Anywhere to back up your YugabyteDB universe YSQL data.

To view, [restore](../../restore-universe-data/ysql/), or delete existing backups for your universe, navigate to that universe and select **Backups**, as per the following illustration:

![Create Backup](/images/yp/create-backup-new-ysql.png)

By default, the list displays all the backups generated for the universe regardless of the time period. You can configure the list to only display the backups created during a specific time period, such as last year,  last month, and so on. In addition, you can specify a custom time period.

To view detailed information about an existing backup, click on it to open **Backup Details**.

The **Backups** page allows you to create new backups that start immediately, as follows:

- Click **Backup now** to open the dialog shown in the following illustration:<br><br>

  ![Backup](/images/yp/create-backup-new-2.png)<br><br>

- In the **Backup Now** dialog, select YSQL as the API type and then complete all the other fields.

  Notice that the contents of the **Select the storage config you want to use for your backup** field list depends on your existing backup storage configurations. For more information, see [Configure backup storage](../../configure-backup-storage/).

- Click **Backup**.

If the universe has [encryption at rest enabled](../../../security/enable-encryption-at-rest), data files are backed up as-is (encrypted) to reduce the computation cost of a backup and to keep the files encrypted. A universe key metadata file, containing key references, is also backed up. To allow YugabyteDB Anywhere to back up your data with the user authentication enabled, follow the instructions provided in [Edit configuration flags](../../../manage-deployments/edit-config-flags) to add the `ysql_enable_auth=true` and `ysql_hba_conf_csv="local all all trust"` YB-TServer flags.

{{< note title="Note" >}}

Versions of YugabyteDB Anywhere prior to 2.11.2.0 do not support backups of YSQL databases that use `enum` types. To mitigate the issue, it is recommended that you use the `ysql_dump` utility in combination with the `/COPY` action as a workaround.

{{< /note >}}

<!-- The preceding note should say 2.11.2.0. Careful with search and replace on version numbers! -->

For information on how to schedule backups for a later time or as a recurring task, see [Schedule universe YSQL data backups](../../schedule-data-backups/ysql/).

To access a list of all backups from all universes, including the deleted universes, navigate to **Backups** on the YugabyteDB Anywhere left-side menu.
