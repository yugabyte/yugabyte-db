### Overview

YugabyteDB Anywhere is best fit for mission-critical deployments, such as production or pre-production testing. The YugabyteDB Anywhere UI is used in a highly-available mode, allowing you to create and manage YugabyteDB universes, or clusters, on one or more regions across public cloud and private on-premises data centers.

YugabyteDB Anywhere is a containerized application that you can install using [Replicated](https://www.replicated.com/) for production, performance, or failure mode testing. For local development or simple functional testing you can also use [YugabyteDB](../../quick-start/).

You can access YugabyteDB Anywhere via an Internet browser that has been supported by its maker in the past 24 months and that has a market share of at least 0.2%. In addition, you can access YugabyteDB Anywhere via most mobile browsers, except Opera Mini.

YugabyteDB Anywhere offers three levels of user accounts: Super Admin, Admin, and Read-only, with the latter having rather limited access to functionality. Unless otherwise specified, the YugabyteDB Anywhere documentation describes the functionality available to a Super Admin user.
