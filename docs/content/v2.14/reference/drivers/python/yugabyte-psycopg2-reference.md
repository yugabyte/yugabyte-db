This page provides details for getting started with `YugabyteDB Psycopg2 Driver` for connecting to YugabyteDB YSQL API.

[Yugabyte Psycopg2 driver](https://github.com/yugabyte/psycopg2) is a distributed python driver for [YSQL](../../../../api/ysql/) built on the [PostgreSQL psycopg2 driver](https://github.com/psycopg/psycopg2).
Although the upstream PostgreSQL psycopg2 driver works with YugabyteDB, the Yugabyte driver enhances YugabyteDB by eliminating the need for external load balancers.

- It is **cluster-aware**, which eliminates the need for an external load balancer.

- It is **topology-aware**, which is essential for geographically-distributed applications.

  The driver uses servers that are part of a set of geo-locations specified by topology keys.

## Load balancing

The Yugabyte Psycopg2 driver has the following load balancing features:

- Uniform load balancing

   In this mode, the driver makes the best effort to uniformly distribute the connections to each YugabyteDB server. For example, if a client application creates 100 connections to a YugabyteDB cluster consisting of 10 servers, then the driver creates 10 connections to each server. If the number of connections are not exactly divisible by the number of servers, then a few may have 1 less or 1 more connection than the others. This is the client view of the load, so the servers may not be well balanced if other client applications are not using the YugabyteDB Psycopg2 driver.

- Topology-aware load balancing

   Because YugabyteDB clusters can have servers in different regions and availability zones, the YugabyteDB Psycopg2 driver is topology-aware, and can be configured to create connections only on servers that are in specific regions and zones. This is helpful for client applications that need to connect to the geographically nearest regions and availability zone for lower latency; the driver tries to uniformly load only those servers that belong to the specified regions and zone.

The YugabyteDB Psycopg2 driver can be configured with pooling as well.

## Quick start

Learn how to establish a connection to YugabyteDB database and begin CRUD operations using the steps in [Build an Application](../../../../quick-start/build-apps/java/ysql-yb-jdbc) in the Quick Start section.

## Download the driver dependency

Building Psycopg requires a few prerequisites (a C compiler and some development packages). Check the [installation instructions](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/install.html#build-prerequisites) and [the FAQ](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/faq.html#faq-compile) for details.

The YugabyteDB Psycopg2 requires PostgreSQL version 11 or above (preferably 14).

If prerequisites are met, you can install psycopg2-yugabytedb like any other Python package, using pip to download it from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/psycopg2-yugabytedb/):

```sh
$ pip install psycopg2-yugabytedb
```

Or, you can use the setup.py script if you've downloaded the source package locally:

```sh
$ python setup.py build
$ sudo python setup.py install
```

### Load balancing connection properties

The following connection properties need to be added to enable load balancing:

- load_balance - enable cluster-aware load balancing by setting this property to `true`; disabled by default.
- topology_keys - provide comma-separated geo-location values to enable topology-aware load balancing. Geo-locations can be provided as `cloud.region.zone`.

## Use the driver

To use the driver, do the following:

- Pass new connection properties for load balancing in the connection string or in the dictionary.

  To enable uniform load balancing across all servers, you set the `load-balance` property to `true` in the Connection string or dictionary, as per the following examples:

    Connection String

    ```python
    conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=database_name host=hostname port=port user=username  password=password load_balance=true")
    ```

    Connection Dictionary

    ```python
    conn = psycopg2.connect(user = 'username', password='xxx', host = 'hostname', port = 'port', dbname = 'database_name', load_balance='True')
    ```

  To specify topology keys, you set the `topology_keys` property to comma-separated values in the Connection string or dictionary, as per the following     examples:

    Connection String

    ```python
    conn = psycopg2.connect("dbname=database_name host=hostname port=port user=username  password=password load_balance=true topology_keys=cloud1.region1.zone1,cloud2.region2.zone2")
    ```

    Connection Dictionary

    ```python
    conn = psycopg2.connect(user = 'username', password='xxx', host = 'hostname', port = 'port', dbname = 'database_name', load_balance='True', topology_keys='cloud1.region1.zone1,cloud2.region2.zone2')
    ```

- To configure a SimpleConnectionPool, specify load balance as follows:

    ```python
    yb_pool = psycopg2.pool.SimpleConnectionPool(1, 10, user="yugabyte",
                                                            password="yugabyte",
                                                            host="127.0.0.1",
                                                            port="5433",
                                                            database="yugabyte",
                                                            load_balance="True")
    conn = yb_pool.getconn()
    ```

## Try it out

This tutorial shows how to use the Yugabyte Psycopg2 driver with YugabyteDB. You’ll start by creating a 3 node cluster with a replication factor of 3. This tutorial uses the [yb-ctl](/preview/admin/yb-ctl/#root) utility.
Next, you’ll use Python shell terminal, to demonstrate the driver's load balancing features by running few python scripts.

### Install YugabyteDB and create a local cluster

Create a universe with a 3-node RF-3 cluster with some fictitious geo-locations assigned. The placement values used are just tokens and have nothing to do with actual AWS cloud regions and zones.

```sh
$ cd <path-to-yugabytedb-installation>

./bin/yb-ctl create --rf 3 --placement_info "aws.us-west.us-west-2a,aws.us-west.us-west-2a,aws.us-west.us-west-2b"
```

### Check uniform load balancing

- Log into your Python terminal and run the following script:

   ```python
   import psycopg2
   conns = []
   for i in range(30):
       conn = psycopg2.connect(user = 'username', password='xxx', host = 'hostname', port = 'port', dbname = 'database_name', load_balance='True')
       conns.append(conn)
   ```

- The application creates 30 connections. To verify the behavior, wait for the app to create connections and then visit `http://<host>:13000/rpcz` from your browser for each node to see that the connections are equally distributed among the nodes. This URL presents a list of connections where each element of the list has some information about the connection as shown in the following screenshot. You can count the number of connections from that list, or search for the occurrence count of the `host` keyword on that webpage. Each node should have 10 connections.

- You can also verify the number of connections by running the following script in the same terminal:

   ```python
   from psycopg2.policies import ClusterAwareLoadBalancer as lb
   obj = lb()
   obj.printHostToConnMap()
   ```

This displays a key value pair map where the keys are the host and the values are the number of connections on them (This is the client side perspective of the number of connections).

### Check topology-aware load balancing using yb-sample-apps

- Run the following script in your new Python terminal with the `topology_keys` property set to `aws.us-west.us-west-2a`; only two nodes will be used in this case.

   ```python
   import psycopg2
   conns = []
   for i in range(30):
       conn = psycopg2.connect(user = 'username', password='xxx', host = 'hostname', port = 'port', dbname = 'database_name', load_balance='True',    topology_keys='aws.us-west.us-west-2a')
       conns.append(conn)
   ```

- To verify the behavior, wait for the app to create connections and then navigate to `http://<host>:13000/rpcz`. The first two nodes should have 15 connections each, and the third node should have zero connections. You can also verify this by running the previous verify script in the same terminal.

## Clean up

When you're done experimenting, run the following command to destroy the local cluster:

```sh
./bin/yb-ctl destroy
```
