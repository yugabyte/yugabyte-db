You now have a cluster/universe on six nodes with a replication factor of `3`. Assume their IP addresses are `172.151.17.130`, `172.151.17.220`, `172.151.17.140`, `172.151.17.150`, `172.151.17.160`, and `172.151.17.170`. YB-Master servers are running on only the first three of these nodes.

## View the master UI dashboard

You should now be able to view the master dashboard on the IP address of any master. In this example, this is one of the following URLs:

- `http://172.151.17.130:7000`
- `http://172.151.17.220:7000`
- `http://172.151.17.140:7000`

{{< tip title="Tip" >}}

If this is a public cloud deployment, remember to use the public IP for the nodes, or a HTTP proxy to view these pages.

```

Clients can connect to YCQL API at the following addresses:

```sh
