## function isfinite() returns boolean

Here is the interesting part of the output from \\_df isfinite()_:

```output
 Result data type |     Argument data types
------------------+-----------------------------
 boolean          | abstime
 boolean          | date
 boolean          | interval
 boolean          | timestamp with time zone
 boolean          | timestamp without time zone
```

The data type _abstime_ is for internal use only. It inevitably shows up in the \\_df_ output. But you should simply forget that it exists.

Here's a trivial demonstration of the meaning of the function _isfinite()_:

```plpgsql
do $body$
begin
  assert not isfinite( 'infinity'::timestamptz), 'Assert #1 failed';
  assert not isfinite('-infinity'::timestamptz), 'Assert #2 failed';
end;
$body$;
```

The block finishes without error.

## function age() returns interval

Nominally, _age()_ returns the age of something "now" with respect to a date of birth. The value of "now" can be given: _either_ explicitly, using the two-parameter overload, as the invocation's first actual argument; _or_ implicitly, using the one-parameter overload, as _date_trunc('day', clock_timestamp())_. The value for the date of birth is given, for both overloads, as the invocation's last actual argument. Of course, this statement of purpose is circular because it avoids saying precisely how age is defined—and why a notion is needed that's different from what is given simply by subtracting the date of birth from "now", using the native minus operator, `-`.

Here is the interesting part of the output from \\_df age()_. The rows were re-ordered manually and whitespace was manually added to improve the readability:

```output
 Result data type |                   Argument data types
------------------+----------------------------------------------------------
 interval         | timestamp without time zone, timestamp without time zone
 interval         | timestamp with time zone, timestamp with time zone

 interval         | timestamp without time zone
 interval         | timestamp with time zone
```

{{< note title="The 'xid' overload of 'age()' has nothing to do with date-time data types" >}}
There's an overload with _xid_ argument data type (and with _integer_ return). The present [Date and time data types](../../../type_datetime/) major section does not describe the _xid_ overload of _age()_.
{{< /note >}}

This section first discusses age as a notion. Then it defines the semantics of the two-parameter overload of the built-in _age()_ function by modeling its implementation. The semantics of the one-parameter overload is defined trivially in terms of the semantics of the two-parameter overload.

### The definition of age is a matter of convention

Age is defined as the length of time that a person (or a pet, a tree, a car, a building, a civilization, the planet Earth, the Universe, or any phenomenon of interest) has lived (or has been in existence). Here is a plausible formula in the strict domain of date-time arithmetic:

```output
age ◄— todays_date - date_of_birth
```

If _todays_date_ and _date_of_birth_ are _date_ values, then _age_ is produced as an _int_ value. And if _todays_date_ and _date_of_birth_ are plain _timestamp_ values (or _timestamptz_ values), then _age_ is produced as an _interval_ value. As long as the time-of-day component of each plain _timestamp_ value is exactly _00:00:00_ (and this is how people think of dates and ages) then only the _dd_ component of the internal _[\[mm, dd, ss\]](../../date-time-data-types-semantics/type-interval/interval-representation/)_ representation of the resulting  _interval_ value will be non-zero. Try this:

```plpgsql
drop function age_in_days(text, text);
create function age_in_days(today_text in text, dob_text in text)
  returns table (z text)
  language plpgsql
as $body$
declare
  d_today   constant date      not null := today_text;
  d_dob     constant date      not null := dob_text;
  t_today   constant timestamp not null := today_text;
  t_dob     constant timestamp not null := dob_text;
begin
  z := (d_today - d_dob)::text;     return next;
  z := (t_today - t_dob)::text;     return next;
end;
$body$;

select z from age_in_days('290000-08-17', '0999-01-04 BC');
```

This is the result:

```output
 106285063
 106285063 days
```

{{< /note >}}

However, how ages are stated is very much a matter of convention. Beyond, say, one's mid teens, it is given simply as an integral number of years. (Sue Townsend's novel title, "The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 3/4", tells the reader that it's a humorous work and that Adrian is childish for his years.) The answer to "What is the age of the earth?" is usually given as "about 4.5 billion years"—and this formulation implies that a precision of about one hundred thousand years is appropriate. At the other end of the spectrum, the age of new born babies is usually given first as an integral number of days, and later, but while still a toddler, as an integral number of months. Internet search finds articles with titles like "Your toddler's developmental milestones at 18 months". You'll even hear age given as, say, "25 months".

Internet search finds lots of formulas to calculate age in years—usually using spreadsheet arithmetic. It's easy to translate what they do into SQL primitives. The essential point of the formula is that if today's month-and-date is earlier in the year than the month-and-date of the date-of-birth, then you haven't yet reached your birthday.

 Try this:

```plpgsql
drop function age_in_years(text, text);
create function age_in_years(today_tz in timestamptz, dob_tz in timestamptz)
  returns interval
  language plpgsql
as $body$
declare
  d_today      constant date      not null := today_tz;
  d_dob        constant date      not null := dob_tz;

  yy_today     constant int       not null := extract(year  from d_today);
  mm_today     constant int       not null := extract(month from d_today);
  dd_today     constant int       not null := extract(day   from d_today);

  yy_dob       constant int       not null := extract(year  from d_dob);
  mm_dob       constant int       not null := extract(month from d_dob);
  dd_dob       constant int       not null := extract(day   from d_dob);

  mm_dd_today  constant date not null := make_date(year=>1, month=>mm_today, day=>dd_today);
  mm_dd_dob    constant date not null := make_date(year=>1, month=>mm_dob,   day=>dd_dob);

  -- Is today's mm-dd greater than dob's mm-dd?
  delta        constant int       not null := case
                                                when mm_dd_today >= mm_dd_dob then 0
                                                else                              -1
                                              end;
  age          constant interval not null := make_interval(years=>(yy_today - yy_dob + delta));
begin
  return age;
end;
$body$;

set timezone = 'America/Los_Angeles';
select
  age_in_years('2007-02-13',      '1984-02-14')::text as "age one day before birthday",
  age_in_years('2007-02-14',      '1984-02-14')::text as "age on birthday",
  age_in_years('2007-02-15',      '1984-02-14')::text as "age one day after birthday",
  age_in_years(clock_timestamp(), '1984-02-14')::text as "age right now";
```

This is the result (when the _select_ is executed in October 2021):

```output
 age one day before birthday | age on birthday | age one day after birthday | age right now
-----------------------------+-----------------+----------------------------+---------------
 22 years                    | 23 years        | 23 years                   | 37 years
```

You can easily derive the function _age_in_months()_ from the function _age_in_years()_. Then, with all three functions in place, _age_in_days()_, _age_in_months()_, and _age_in_years()_, you can implement an _age()_ function that applies a rule-of-thumb, based on threshold values for what _age_in_days()_ returns, to return either a pure days, a pure months, or a pure years _interval_ value. This is left as an exercise for the reader.

### The semantics of the built-in function age()

{{< note title="The following account relies on understanding the internal representation of an 'interval' value" >}}
The internal representation of an _interval_ value is a _[mm, dd, ss]_ tuple. This is explained in the section [How does YSQL represent an _interval_ value?](../../date-time-data-types-semantics/type-interval/interval-representation/).
{{< /note >}}

Bare _timestamp_ subtraction produces a result where the _yy_ field is always _zero_ and only the _mm_ and _dd_ fields might be non-zero, thus:

```plpgsql
select (
  '2001-04-10 12:43:17'::timestamp -
  '1957-06-13 11:41:13'::timestamp)::text;
```

This is the result:

```output
 16007 days 01:02:04
```

See the section [The moment-moment overloads of the "-" operator for _timestamptz_, _timestamp_, and _time_](../../date-time-data-types-semantics/type-interval/interval-arithmetic/moment-moment-overloads-of-minus/) for more information.

The PostgreSQL documentation, in [Table 9.30. Date/Time Functions](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/functions-datetime.html#FUNCTIONS-DATETIME-TABLE), describes how _age()_ calculates its result thus:

> Subtract arguments, producing a "symbolic" result that uses years and months, rather than just days

and it gives this example:

```plpgsql
select age(
  '2001-04-10'::timestamp,
  '1957-06-13'::timestamp)::text;
```

with this result:

```output
43 years 9 mons 27 days
```

Because the result data type is _interval_, and there's no such thing as a "symbolic" _interval_ value, this description is simply nonsense. It presumably means that the result is a hybrid _interval_ value where the _yy_ field might be non-zero.

{{< note title="'age(t2, ts1)' versus 'justify_interval(ts2 - ts1)'" >}}
While, as was shown above, subtracting one _timestamp[tz]_ value from another produces an _interval_ value whose _mm_ component is always _zero_, you can use _justify_interval()_ to produce a value that, in general, has a _non-zero_ value for each of the _mm_, dd_, and _ss_ components. However, the actual value produced by doing this will, in general, differ from that produced by invoking _age()_, even when the results are compared with the native equals operator, `=`, (and not the [user-defined "strict equals"](../../date-time-data-types-semantics/type-interval/interval-utilities/#the-user-defined-strict-equals-interval-interval-operator) operator, `==`). Try this:

```plpsql
set timezone = 'UTC';
with
  c1 as (
    select
      '2021-03-17 13:43:19 America/Los_Angeles'::timestamptz as ts2,
      '2000-05-19 11:19:13 America/Los_Angeles'::timestamptz as ts1),
  c2 as (
    select
      age             (ts2,  ts1) as a,
      justify_interval(ts2 - ts1) as j
    from c1)
select
  a::text       as "age(ts2,  ts1)",
  j::text       as "justify_interval(ts2 - ts1)",
  (a = j)::text as "age() = justify_interval() using native equals"
from c2;
```

This is the result:

```output
          age(ts2,  ts1)          |   justify_interval(ts2 - ts1)   | age() = justify_interval() using native equals
----------------------------------+---------------------------------+------------------------------------------------
 20 years 9 mons 29 days 02:24:06 | 21 years 1 mon 17 days 02:24:06 | false
```

They differ simply because _justify_interval()_ uses one rule (see the subsection [The _justify_hours()_, _justify_days()_, and _justify_interval()_ built-in functions](../../date-time-data-types-semantics/type-interval/justfy-and-extract-epoch/#the-justify-hours-justify-days-and-justify-interval-built-in-functions)) and _age()_ uses a different rule (see the subsection [The semantics of the two-parameter overload of function _age()_](./age/#the-semantics-of-the-two-parameter-overload-of-function-age-timestamp-tz-timestamp-tz)). You should understand the rule that each uses and then decide what you need. But notice [Yugabyte's recommendation](#avoid-using-age), below, simply to avoid using the built-in _age()_ function.
{{< /note >}}

Anyway, the phrase _producing a "symbolic" result_ gives no clue about how _age()_ works in the general case. But it looks like this is what it did with the example above:

- It tried to subtract _"13 days"_ from _"10 days"_ and "borrowed" one month to produce a positive result. As it happens, both June and April have 30 days (with no leap year variation). The result, _"(30 + 10) - 13"_, is _"27 days"_.

- It tried to subtract _"6 months"_ from _"3 months"_ (decremented by one month from its starting value, _"4 months"_, to account for the "borrowed" month), and "borrowed" one year to produce a positive result. One year is always twelve months. The result, _"(12 + 3) - 6"_, is _"9 months"_.

- Finally, it subtracted _"1957 years"_ from _"2000 years"_ (decremented by one year from its starting value, _"2021 years"_, to account for the "borrowed" year).

Here is another example of the result that _age()_ produces when the inputs have non-zero time-of-day components:

```plpgsql
select age(
  '2001-04-10 11:19:17'::timestamp,
  '1957-06-13 15:31:42'::timestamp)::text;
```

with this result:

```output
43 years 9 mons 26 days 19:47:35
```

Nobody ever cites an age like this, with an hours, minutes, and seconds component. But the PostgreSQL designers thought that it was a good idea to implement _age()_ to do this.

Briefly, and approximately, the function _age()_ extracts the _year_, _month_, _day_, and _seconds_ since midnight for each of the two input moment values. It then subtracts these values pairwise and uses them to create an _interval_ value. In general, this will be a hybrid value with non-zero _mm_, _dd_, and _ss_ components. But the statement of the semantics must be made more carefully than this to accommodate the fact that the outcomes of the pairwise differences might be negative.

- For example, if today is _"year 2020 month 4"_ and if the date-of-birth is _"year 2010 month 6"_, then a naïve application of this rule would produce an age of _"10 years -2 months"_. But age is never stated like this. Rather, it's stated as _"9 years 10 months"_. This is rather like doing subtraction of distances measured in imperial feet and inches. When you subtract _"10 feet 6 inches"_ from _"20 feet 4 inches"_ you "borrow" one foot, taking _"10 feet"_ down to _"9 feet"_ so that you can subtract _"6 inches"_ from _"12 + 4 inches"_ to get _"10 inches"_.

However, the borrowing rules get very tricky with dates because "borrowed" months (when pairwise subtraction of _day_ values would produce a negative result) have different numbers of days (and there's leap years to account for too) so the "borrowing" rules get to be quite baroque—so much so that it's impractical to explain the semantics of _age()_ in prose. Rather, you need to model the implementation. PL/pgSQL is perfect for this.

<a name="avoid-using-age"></a>The full account of _age()_ is presented on its own <a href = "./age">dedicated child page</a>.

{{< tip title="Avoid using the built-in 'age()' function." >}}
The rule that _age()_ uses to produce its result cannot be expressed clearly in prose. And, anyway, it produces a result with an entirely inappropriate apparent precision. Yugabyte recommends that you decide how you want to define age for your present use case and then implement the definition that you choose along the lines used in the user-defined functions _age_in_days()_ and _age_in_years()_ shown above in the subsection [The definition of age is a matter of convention](#the-definition-of-age-is-a-matter-of-convention).
{{< /tip >}}

## function extract() \| function date_part() returns double precision

The function _extract()_, and the alternative syntax that the function _date_part()_ supports for the same semantics, return a _double precision_ value corresponding to a nominated so-called _field_, like _year_ or _second_, from the input _date-time_ value.

The full account of _extract()_ and _date_part()_ is presented on its own [dedicated child page](./extract).

## function timezone() \| 'at time zone' operator returns timestamp \| timestamptz

The function _timezone()_, and the alternative syntax that operator _at time zone_ supports for the same semantics, return a plain _timestamp_ value from a _timestamptz_ input or a _timestamptz_ value from a plain _timestamp_ input. The effect is the same as if a simple typecast is used from one data type to the other after using _set timezone_ to specify the required timezone.

```output
timezone(<timezone>, timestamp[tz]_value) == timestamp[tz]_value at time zone <timezone>
```

Try this example:

```plpgsql
with c as (
  select '2021-09-22 13:17:53.123456 Europe/Helsinki'::timestamptz as tstz)
select
  (timezone('UTC',           tstz) = tstz at time zone 'UTC'          )::text as "with timezone given as text",
  (timezone(make_interval(), tstz) = tstz at time zone make_interval())::text as "with timezone given as interval"
from c;
```

This is the result:

```output
 with timezone given as text | with timezone given as interval
-----------------------------+---------------------------------
 true                        | true
```

(Because all _make_interval()_'s formal parameters have default values of _zero_, you can invoke it with no actual arguments.)

Now try this example:

```plpgsql
set timezone = 'UTC';
with c as (
  select '2021-09-22 13:17:53.123456 Europe/Helsinki'::timestamptz as tstz)
select
  (timezone('UTC', tstz) = tstz::timestamp)::text
from c;
```

The result is _true_.

The function syntax is more expressive than the operator syntax because its overloads distinguish explicitly between specifying the timezone by name or as an _interval_ value. Here is the interesting part of the output from \\_df timezone()_. The rows were re-ordered manually and whitespace was manually added to improve the readability:

```output
      Result data type       |          Argument data types
-----------------------------+---------------------------------------
 timestamp with time zone    | text, timestamp without time zone
 timestamp without time zone | text, timestamp with time zone

 timestamp with time zone    | interval, timestamp without time zone
 timestamp without time zone | interval, timestamp with time zone
```

The rows for the _timetz_ argument data types were removed manually, respecting the recommendation [here](../../../type_datetime/#avoid-timetz) to avoid using this data type. (You can't get \\_df_ output for the operator _at time zone_.)

{{< tip title="Avoid using the 'at time zone' operator and use only the function 'timezone()'." >}}
Because the function syntax is more expressive than the operator syntax, Yugabyte recommends using only the former syntax. Moreover, never use _timezone()_ bare but, rather, use it only via the overloads of the user-defined wrapper function _at_timezone()_ and as described in the section [Recommended practice for specifying the UTC offset](../../../type_datetime/timezones/recommendation/).
{{< /tip >}}

## 'overlaps' operator returns boolean

The account of the _overlaps_ operator first explains the semantics in prose and pictures. Then it presents two implementations that model the semantics and shows that they produce the same results.

### 'overlaps' semantics in prose

The _overlaps_ operator determines if two durations have any moments in common. The _overlaps_ invocation defines a duration either by its bounding moments or by its one bounding moment and the size of the duration (expressed as an _interval_ value). There are therefore _four_ alternative general invocation syntaxes. Either:

```output
overlaps_result ◄— (left-duration-bound-1, left-duration-bound-2) overlaps (right-duration-bound-1, right-duration-bound-2)
```

or:

```output
overlaps_result ◄— (left-duration-bound-1, left-duration-size) overlaps (right-duration-bound-1, right-duration-bound-2)
```

or:

```output
overlaps_result ◄— (left-duration-bound-1, left-duration-bound-2) overlaps (right-duration-bound-1, right-duration-size)
```

or:

```output
overlaps_result ◄— (left-duration-bound-1, left-duration-size) overlaps (right-duration-bound-1, right-duration-size)
```

Unlike other phenomena that have a length, date-time durations are special because time flows inexorably _from_ earlier moments _to_ later moments. It's convenient to say that, when the invocation as presented has been processed, a duration is ultimately defined by its start moment and its finish moment—even if one of these is derived from the other by the size of the duration. In the degenerate case, where the start and finish moments coincide, the duration becomes an instant.

Notice that, while it's natural to write the start moment before the finish moment, the result is insensitive to the order of the boundary moments or to the sign of the size of the duration. The result is also insensitive to which duration, "left" or "right" is written first.

This prose account of the semantics starts with some simple examples. Then it states the rules carefully and examines critical edges cases.

#### Simple examples.

Here's a simple positive example:

```plpgsql
select (
    ('07:00:00'::time, '09:00:00'::time) overlaps
    ('08:00:00'::time, '10:00:00'::time)
  )::text as "time durations overlap";
```

This is the result:

```output
 time durations overlap
------------------------
 true
```

And here are some invocation variants that express durations with the same ultimate derived start and finish moments:

```plpgsql
do $body$
declare
  seven      constant time     not null := '07:00:00';
  eight      constant time     not null := '08:00:00';
  nine       constant time     not null := '09:00:00';
  ten        constant time     not null := '10:00:00';
  two_hours  constant interval not null := make_interval(hours=>2);

  r1         constant boolean  not null := (seven, nine)        overlaps  (eight, ten);
  r2         constant boolean  not null := (seven, two_hours)   overlaps  (eight, ten);
  r3         constant boolean  not null := (seven, nine)        overlaps  (eight, two_hours);
  r4         constant boolean  not null := (seven, two_hours)   overlaps  (eight, two_hours);

  r5         constant boolean  not null := (nine,  seven)       overlaps  (ten,   eight);
  r6         constant boolean  not null := (nine,  -two_hours)  overlaps  (ten,   -two_hours);
begin
  assert ((r1 = r2) and (r1 = r3) and (r1 = r4) and (r1 = r5) and (r1 = r6)), 'Assert failed';
end;
$body$;
```

The block finishes silently, showing that the result from each of the six variants is the same.

The operator is supported by the _overlaps()_ function. Here is the interesting part of the output from \\_df overlaps()_:

```output
 Result data type |                                                Argument data types
------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 boolean          | time, time,                   time, time
 boolean          | time, interval,               time, time
 boolean          | time, time,                   time, interval
 boolean          | time, interval,               time, interval

 boolean          | timestamp, timestamp,         timestamp, timestamp
 boolean          | timestamp, interval,          timestamp, timestamp
 boolean          | timestamp, timestamp,         timestamp, interval
 boolean          | timestamp, interval,          timestamp, interval

 boolean          | timestamptz, timestamptz,     timestamptz, timestamptz
 boolean          | timestamptz, interval,        timestamptz, timestamptz
 boolean          | timestamptz, timestamptz,     timestamptz, interval
 boolean          | timestamptz, interval,        timestamptz, interval
```

The rows for the _timetz_ argument data types were removed manually, respecting the recommendation [here](../../../type_datetime/#avoid-timetz) to avoid using this data type. Also, to improve the readability:

- the rows were reordered
- _time without time zone_ was rewritten as _time_,
- _timestamp without time zone_ was rewritten as _timestamp_,
- _timestamp with time zone_ was rewritten as _timestamptz_,
- blank rows and spaces were inserted manually

This boils down to saying that _overlaps_ supports durations whose boundary moments are one of _time_, plain _timestamp_, or _timestamptz_. There is no support for _date_ durations. But you can achieve the functionality that such support would bring simply by typecasting _date_ values to plain _timestamp_ values and using the plain _timestamp_ overload. If you do this, avoid the overloads with an _interval_ argument because of the risk that a badly-chosen _interval_ value will result in a boundary moment with a non-zero time component. Rather, achieve that effect by adding an _integer_ value to a _date_ value _before_ typecasting to plain _timestamp_.

Here is an example:

```plpgsql
select (
    ( ('2020-01-01'::date)::timestamp, ('2020-01-01'::date + 2)::timestamp ) overlaps
    ( ('2020-01-02'::date)::timestamp, ('2020-01-01'::date + 2)::timestamp )
  )::text as "date durations overlap";
```

This is the result:

```output
 date durations overlap
------------------------
 true
```

#### Rule statement and edge cases

Because (unless the duration collapses to an instant) one of the boundary moments will inevitably be earlier than the other, it's useful to assume that some pre-processing has been done and to write the general invocation syntax using the vocabulary _start-moment_ and _finish-moment_. Moreover (except when both durations start at the identical moment and finish at the identical moment), it's always possible to decide which is the earlier-duration and which is the later-duration. Otherwise (when the two durations exactly coincide), it doesn't matter which is labeled earlier and which is labeled later.

- If the left-duration's start-moment is less than the right-duration's start-moment, then the left-duration is the _earlier-duration_ and the right-duration is the _later-duration_.

- If the right-duration's start-moment is less than the left-duration's start-moment, then the right-duration is the _earlier-duration_ and the left-duration is the _later-duration_.

- Else, if the left-duration's start-moment and the right-duration's start-moment are identical, then

  - If the left-duration's finish-moment is less than the right-duration's finish-moment, then the left-duration is the _earlier-duration_ and the right-duration is the _later-duration_.

  - If the right-duration's finish-moment is less than the left-duration's finish-moment, then the right-duration is the _earlier-duration_ and the left-duration is the _later-duration_.

It's most useful, in order to express the rules and to discuss the edge cases, to write the general invocation syntax using the vocabulary _earlier-duration_ and _later-duration_ together with _start-moment_ and _finish-moment_, thus:

```output
overlaps_result ◄— (earlier-duration-start-moment, earlier-duration-finish-moment) overlaps (later-duration-start-moment, later-duration-finish-moment)
```

The _overlaps_ operator treats a duration as a closed-open range. In other words:

```output
duration == [start-moment, finish-moment)
```

However, even when a duration collapses to an instant, it is considered to be non-empty. (When the end-points of a `'[)'` _range_ value are identical, this value _is_ considered to be empty and cannot overlap with any other range value.)

Because the _start-moment_ is included in the duration but the _finish-moment_ is not, this leads to the requirement to state the following edge case rules. (These rules were established by the SQL Standard.)

- If the left duration is not collapsed to an instant, and the _left-duration-finish-moment_ is identical to the _right-duration-start-moment_, then the two durations _do not_ overlap. This holds both when the right duration is not collapsed to an instant and when it is so collapsed.
- If the left duration is collapsed to an instant, and the _left-duration-start-and-finish-moment_ is identical to the _right-duration-start-moment_, then the two durations _do_ overlap. This holds both when the right duration is not collapsed to an instant and when it is so collapsed. In other words, when two instants coincide, they _do_ overlap.

Notice that these rules are different from those for the `&&` operator between a pair of `'[)'`  _range_ values. (The `&&` operator is also referred to as the _overlaps_ operator for _range_ values.) The differences are seen, in some cases, when instants are involved. Try this:

```plpgsql
with
  c1 as (
    select '2000-01-01 12:00:00'::timestamp as the_instant),
  c2 as (
    select
      the_instant,
      tsrange(the_instant, the_instant, '[)') as instant_range -- notice '[)'
  from c1)
select
  the_instant,
  isempty(instant_range)                                            ::text as "is empty",
  ( (the_instant, the_instant) overlaps (the_instant, the_instant) )::text as "overlaps",
  ( instant_range              &&       instant_range              )::text as "&&"
from c2;
```

This is the result:

```output
     the_instant     | is empty | overlaps |  &&
---------------------+----------+----------+-------
 2000-01-01 12:00:00 | true     | true     | false
```

In order to get the outcome _true_ from the `&&` operator, you have to change definition of the ranges from open-closed, `'[)'`, to open-open, `'[]'`, thus:

```plpgsql
with
  c1 as (
    select '2000-01-01 12:00:00'::timestamp as the_instant),
  c2 as (
    select
      the_instant,
      tsrange(the_instant, the_instant, '[]') as instant_range -- notice '[]'
  from c1)
select
  the_instant,
  isempty(instant_range)                                            ::text as "is empty",
  ( (the_instant, the_instant) overlaps (the_instant, the_instant) )::text as "overlaps",
  ( instant_range              &&       instant_range              )::text as "&&"
from c2;
```

This is the new result:

```output
     the_instant     | is empty | overlaps |  &&
---------------------+----------+----------+------
 2000-01-01 12:00:00 | false    | true     | true
```

It doesn't help to ask why the rules are different for the _overlaps_ operator acting between two explicitly specified durations and the `&&` acting between two _range_ values. It simply is what it is—and the rules won't change.

Notice that you _can_ make the outcomes of the _overlaps_ operator and the `&&` operator agree for all tests. But to get this outcome, you must surround the use of `&&` with some if-then-else logic to choose when to use `'[)'` and when to use `'[]'`. Code that does this is presented on this [dedicated child page](./overlaps/).

The following diagram shows all the interesting cases.

### Two implementations that model the 'overlaps' semantics and that produce the same results

These are presented and explained on this [dedicated child page](./overlaps/). The page also presents the tests that show that, for each set of inputs that jointly probe all the interesting cases, the two model implementations produce the same result as each other and the same result as the native _overlaps_ operator, thus:

```output
