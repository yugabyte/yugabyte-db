**Purpose:** Provide the identical functionality to the [`#>>`](../subvalue-operators/) operator.

**Signature** For the `jsonb` variant:

```
input value:       jsonb, VARIADIC text
return value:      text
```

**Notes:** The result of `jsonb_extract_path_text()` bears the same relationship to the result of its [`jsonb_extract_path()`](../jsonb-extract-path) counterpart as does the result of the [`#>>`](../subvalue-operators/) operator to that of its [`#>`](../subvalue-operators/) counterpart. For the same reason that there is no reason to prefer `jsonb_extract_path()` over `#>`, there is no reason to prefer `jsonb_extract_path_text()` over `#>>`.
