{{< tip title="Download the code examples" >}}

All of the `.sql` scripts that this section presents for copy-and-paste at the `ysqlsh` prompt are included for download in a zip-file.

[Download `recursive-cte-code-examples.zip`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/master/sample/recursive-cte-code-examples/recursive-cte-code-examples.zip).

After unzipping it on a convenient new directory, you'll see a `README.txt`.  It tells you how to start a couple of master-scripts. Simply start each in `ysqlsh`. You can run them time and again. They always finish silently. You can see the reports that they produce on dedicated spool directories and confirm that your reports are identical to the reference copies that are delivered in the zip-file.

A _graph_ is a network of _nodes_ (sometimes called vertices) and _edges_ (sometimes called arcs). An edge joins a pair of nodes.

- When every edge is _undirected_ (i.e. the relationship between the nodes at each end of an edge is symmetrical), then the graph is called an _undirected_ graph.
- When every edge is _directed_, then the graph is called a _directed_ graph.
- One representation scheme for an  _undirected_ edge chooses to represent this single abstract edge as two physical edges, one in each direction. In this sense, you can think of a general _undirected_ graph as a _directed_ graph where at least one pair of nodes is connected by a pair of edges, one in each direction. By extension of this thinking, a _directed_ graph is one where there is maximum one _directed_ edge between any pair of nodes.
- Most commonly (by virtue of the nature of the inter-node relationship) a graph has either only _undirected_ edges or only _directed_ edges.
- A _path_ is a traversal of the graph that starts at one node, goes along an edge to another node, and then along an edge to yet another node, and so on. You can certainly give meaning to a path that returns many times to nodes that have already been encountered. This is called a _cycle_. But, by convention, this is not done because an algorithm that discovered such a path would run for ever. Rather, it's usual that the definition of a path includes the notion that it has no cycles, so that no node is visited more than once. (A cycle that runs round and round between a pair of immediately connected nodes is always discounted.)
- A graph that has the potential for cycles is called a _cyclic_ graph. And one with no such potential is called an _acyclic_ graph.
- The two degrees of freedom, _undirected_ or _directed_ and _cyclic_ or _acyclic_ are orthogonal—i.e. all four combinations are possible.
- The most general kind of graph is _undirected_ and _cyclic_ and the design of the traversal scheme must account for this. This general scheme will always work on the more specialized kinds of graph.
- A graph might be just _a single set of connected nodes_, where every node can be reached from any other node; or it might be two or more isolated _subgraphs_ of mutually connected nodes where there exists no path between any pair of subgraphs.
- The most general graph traversal scheme, therefore, must discover all the isolated _subgraphs_ and apply the required traversal scheme to each of them. This is beyond the scope of this overall section. It deals only with single connected graphs.

You can use a recursive CTE to find the paths in an _undirected_ _cyclic_ graph. But you must design the SQL explicitly to accommodate the fact that the edges are _undirected_ and you must include an explicit predicate to prevent cycles. Because each other kind of graph described below is a specialization of the graph whose description immediately precedes its description, you can, as mentioned, use progressively simpler SQL to trace paths in these—as long as you know, _a priori_, what kind of graph you're dealing with.

## Undirected cyclic graph

Here is an example of such a graph.

![undirected-cyclic-graph](/images/api/ysql/the-sql-language/with-clause/traversing-general-graphs/undirected-cyclic-graph.jpg)

The [Bacon Numbers problem](../bacon-numbers/) is specified in the context of this kind of graph. Actors have acted in one or more movies. And the cast of a movie is one or more actors. The set of actors of interest is represented as the nodes of a single connected graph, one of whose nodes is Kevin Bacon. When any pair of actors have acted in the same movie, an edge exist between the two of them.

- Setting aside notions like "starring role", "supporting role", and so on, the relationship between a pair of actors who acted in the same movie is symmetrical. So the graph is _undirected_.

- Because, for example, John Malkovich, Brad Pitt, and Winona Ryder all acted in the 1999 movie "Being John Malkovich", you could traverse a path from John Malkovich to Brad Pitt to Winona Ryder and back to John Malkovich, and so on indefinitely. Or you could traverse a path from John Malkovich to Winona Ryder to Brad Pitt and back to John Malkovich, and so on indefinitely. So the graph, in general, is _undirected_ _and_ _cyclic_.

The movies-and-actors use case brings out another point. In general, the edges have properties—in this case the list of movies in which a particular pair of actors have both acted.

You might argue (particularly if you're starting to think of a representation in a SQL database) that the properties of an edge must be single-valued and that there should therefore be many edges between a pair of actors who've been in several movies in common—one for each movie. This is just an example of the usual distinction between the conceptual design (the entity-relationship model) and the logical design (the table model). The basic graph traversal problem is, beyond doubt, best conceptualized in terms of a model that allows just zero or one edge between node pairs. Even so, the traversal implementation can easily accommodate a physical model that allows more than one edge between node pairs.

## Directed cyclic graph

A _directed_ _cyclic_ graph is a specialization of the _undirected_ _cyclic_ graph. Here, the relationship between the nodes at the two ends of an edge is asymmetrical, so each edge has a direction.

![directed-cyclic-graph](/images/api/ysql/the-sql-language/with-clause/traversing-general-graphs/directed-cyclic-graph.jpg)

For example, you might keep a record of all the video-conferences that are held among the employees in an organization. A conference has exactly one _host attendee_ and one or many _invited attendees_. Alice might host several conferences at which Joe attends as an invitee. And Joe might host several conferences at which Alice attends as an invitee. The graph will therefor have two _directed_ edges between Alice and Joe (as is shown between the nodes _n4_ and _n6_ in the picture above). The property of the edge from Alice to Joe could include the list of start timestamps and durations of the conferences that Alice hosted and that Joe attended. And the property of edge from Joe to Alice would then include the list of start timestamps and durations of the conferences that Joe hosted and that Alice attended.

## Directed acyclic graph

A _directed_ _acyclic_ graph is a specialization of the _directed_ _cyclic_ graph.

![directed-acyclic-graph](/images/api/ysql/the-sql-language/with-clause/traversing-general-graphs/directed-acyclic-graph.jpg)

A car manufacturer will record the parts decomposition of each model that it makes. Cars have major components like engines, brakes, exhaust systems, and so on. And many car models (especially, for example, the sedan and wagon variants of a particular marque) will share the same major components. The relationship "is composed of" is clearly asymmetrical. Major components, of course, have their own parts breakdowns into subcomponents, as do the subcomponents in turn all the way down to atomic subcomponents like nuts, bolts, washers, and so on.

## Rooted tree

A rooted tree is a specialization of the _directed_ _acyclic_ graph.

![rooted-tree](/images/api/ysql/the-sql-language/with-clause/traversing-general-graphs/rooted-tree.jpg)

The reporting tree for employees in an organization, whose traversal was discussed in the section [Case study—Using a recursive CTE to traverse an employee hierarchy](../emps-hierarchy/) is the canonical example of such a graph.

## Finding the paths in each of the four kinds of graph

The next sections show how to find the paths in each of the four kinds of graph that are described above.

### Representing the different kinds of graph in a SQL database

[This section](./graph-representation/) describes the minimal table structure for representing graphs.

### Common code for traversing all kinds of graph

[This section](./common-code/) describes common artifacts, like tables into which to insert the results to support subsequent _ad hoc_ queries, and various helper functions and procedures, upon which the described traversal schemes all depend.

### Path finding approaches

The method for the _directed_ _cyclic_ graph is identical to that for the _undirected_ _cyclic_ graph. Each implements cycle prevention. But the table for the _directed_ _cyclic_ graph usually records just the edge as either _"from a to b"_ or _"from b to a"_. Using the recommended representation for edges in a SQL database table, this is the difference:

- The table for the _undirected_ _cyclic_ graph for the edge between nodes _"a"_ and _"b"_ records it twice, as _"from a to b"_ and _"from b to a"_.

- But the table for the _directed_ _cyclic_ graph usually records just the edge as either _"from a to b"_ or _"from b to a"_. Occasionally, when the _directed_ relationship between a particular pair of nodes is reciprocal, two edges will be recorded as _"from a to b"_ and _"from b to a"_.

The method for the _directed_ _acyclic_ graph is identical to that for the rooted tree. Neither implements cycle prevention because there is no need for this (both these kinds of graph, by definition, have no cycles). For the same reason, there is never more than one _directed_ edge between any pair of nodes.

The methods are described in these sections:

- [Finding the paths in a general undirected cyclic graph](./undirected-cyclic-graph/)

- [Finding the paths in a directed cyclic graph](./directed-cyclic-graph/)

- [Finding the paths in a directed acyclic graph](./directed-acyclic-graph/)

- [Finding the paths in a rooted tree](./rooted-tree/)
