Before trying the code in this section, make sure that you have created the supporting infrastructure:

- The _"actors"_, _"movies_", and _"cast_members"_ tables for representing IMDb data—see [`cr-actors-movies-cast-members-tables.sql`](../../bacon-numbers#cr-actors-movies-cast-members-tables-sql)

- The _"edges"_ table and the procedure to populate it from the _"cast_members"_ table—see [`cr-actors-movies-edges-table-and-proc-sql`](../../bacon-numbers#cr-actors-movies-edges-table-and-proc-sql)

- All the code shown in the section [Common code for traversing all kinds of graph](../../traversing-general-graphs/common-code/). Be sure to choose the [cr-raw-paths-with-tracing.sql](../../traversing-general-graphs/common-code#cr-raw-paths-with-tracing-sql) option.

{{< tip title="Download a zip of scripts that include all the code examples that implement this case study" >}}

All of the `.sql` scripts that this section presents for copy-and-paste at the `ysqlsh` prompt are included for download in a zip-file.

[Download `recursive-cte-code-examples.zip`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/master/sample/recursive-cte-code-examples/recursive-cte-code-examples.zip).

After unzipping it on a convenient new directory, you'll see a `README.txt`.  It tells you how to start the master-script that invokes all the child scripts that jointly instantiate the synthetic actors and movies data set and compute the Bacon Numbers on it. Simply start it in `ysqlsh`. You can run it time and again. It always finishes silently. You can see the report that it produces on a dedicated spool directory and confirm that your report is identical to the reference copy that is delivered in the zip-file.

## Install the synthetic actors and movies data

Here is a depiction of the synthetic data that this section uses:

![undirected-cyclic-graph](/images/api/ysql/the-sql-language/with-clause/bacon-numbers/actors-movies-1.jpg)

It has six nodes and nine edges. Use this script to insert the synthetic data:

##### `insert-synthetic-data.sql`

```plpgsql
do $body$
begin
  delete from edges;
  delete from cast_members;
  delete from actors;
  delete from movies;

  insert into actors(actor) values
    ('Alfie'),
    ('Chloe'),
    ('Emily'),
    ('Helen'),
    ('James'),
    ('Steve');

  insert into movies(movie) values
    ('As You Like It'),
    ('Coriolanus'),
    ('Hamlet'),
    ('Julius Caesar'),
    ('King Lear'),
    ('Macbeth'),
    ('Measure for Measure'),
    ('Merry Wives of Windsor'),
    ('Othello'),
    ('Romeo and Juliet'),
    ('Taming of the Shrew'),
    ('The Tempest'),
    ('Twelfth Night');

  insert into cast_members(actor, movie) values

    ( 'Alfie'  ,  'Hamlet'                 ),
    ( 'Alfie'  ,  'Macbeth'                ),
    ( 'Alfie'  ,  'Measure for Measure'    ),
    ( 'Alfie'  ,  'Taming of the Shrew'    ),

    ( 'Helen'  ,  'The Tempest'            ),
    ( 'Helen'  ,  'Hamlet'                 ),
    ( 'Helen'  ,  'King Lear'              ),
    ( 'Helen'  ,  'Measure for Measure'    ),
    ( 'Helen'  ,  'Romeo and Juliet'       ),
    ( 'Helen'  ,  'Taming of the Shrew'    ),
    ( 'Helen'  ,  'Twelfth Night'          ),

    ( 'Emily'  ,  'As You Like It'         ),
    ( 'Emily'  ,  'Coriolanus'             ),
    ( 'Emily'  ,  'Julius Caesar'          ),
    ( 'Emily'  ,  'Merry Wives of Windsor' ),
    ( 'Emily'  ,  'Othello'                ),

    ( 'Chloe'  ,  'Hamlet'                 ),
    ( 'Chloe'  ,  'Julius Caesar'          ),
    ( 'Chloe'  ,  'Merry Wives of Windsor' ),
    ( 'Chloe'  ,  'Romeo and Juliet'       ),

    ( 'James'  ,  'As You Like It'         ),
    ( 'James'  ,  'Coriolanus'             ),
    ( 'James'  ,  'King Lear'              ),
    ( 'James'  ,  'Othello'                ),
    ( 'James'  ,  'Twelfth Night'          ),

    ( 'Steve'  ,  'The Tempest'            ),
    ( 'Steve'  ,  'King Lear'              ),
    ( 'Steve'  ,  'Macbeth'                );
end;
$body$;
```
## Populate the "edges" table and inspect the result

Populate the _"edges"_ table:

```plpgsql
call insert_edges();
```

Confirm that the expected actors are represented:

```plpgsql
with v(actor) as (
  select node_1 from edges
  union
  select node_2 from edges)
select actor from v order by 1;
```

This is the result:

```
 actor
-------
 Alfie
 Chloe
 Emily
 Helen
 James
 Steve
```

Confirm that the expected movies are represented:

```plpgsql
select distinct unnest(movies) as movie
from edges
order by 1;
```

This is the result:

```
         movie
------------------------
 As You Like It
 Coriolanus
 Hamlet
 Julius Caesar
 King Lear
 Macbeth
 Measure for Measure
 Merry Wives of Windsor
 Othello
 Romeo and Juliet
 Taming of the Shrew
 The Tempest
 Twelfth Night
```

List the edges that have _"node_1 < node_2"_:

```plpgsql
select
  node_1,
  node_2,
  replace(translate(movies::text, '{"}', ''), ',', ' | ')  as movies
from edges
where node_1 < node_2
order by 1, 2;
```

The same crude technique to make the paths more readily human-readable is used here as is used in the stored procedure that the [`cr-list-paths.sql`](../../traversing-general-graphs/common-code/#cr-list-paths-sql) script uses.

You see the expected nine edges:

```
 node_1 | node_2 |                       movies
--------+--------+----------------------------------------------------
 Alfie  | Chloe  | Hamlet
 Alfie  | Helen  | Hamlet | Measure for Measure | Taming of the Shrew
 Alfie  | Steve  | Macbeth
 Chloe  | Emily  | Julius Caesar | Merry Wives of Windsor
 Chloe  | Helen  | Hamlet | Romeo and Juliet
 Emily  | James  | As You Like It | Coriolanus | Othello
 Helen  | James  | King Lear | Twelfth Night
 Helen  | Steve  | King Lear | The Tempest
 James  | Steve  | King Lear
```

Now list the edges that have the opposite direction:

```plpgsql
select
  node_1,
  node_2,
  replace(translate(movies::text, '{"}', ''), ',', ' | ')  as movies
from edges
where node_1 > node_2
order by 2, 1;
```

Again, you see the expected nine edges:

```
 node_1 | node_2 |                       movies
--------+--------+----------------------------------------------------
 Chloe  | Alfie  | Hamlet
 Helen  | Alfie  | Hamlet | Measure for Measure | Taming of the Shrew
 Steve  | Alfie  | Macbeth
 Emily  | Chloe  | Julius Caesar | Merry Wives of Windsor
 Helen  | Chloe  | Hamlet | Romeo and Juliet
 James  | Emily  | As You Like It | Coriolanus | Othello
 James  | Helen  | King Lear | Twelfth Night
 Steve  | Helen  | King Lear | The Tempest
 Steve  | James  | King Lear
```

Each result shows the same set of six nodes and nine edges that you see in the picture above. The section [Finding the paths in a general undirected cyclic graph](../../traversing-general-graphs/undirected-cyclic-graph/) explained that this denormalized representation of the edges in an undirected cyclic graph allows the most straightforward implementation of the recursive CTE that finds the paths.

## Find the paths

Invoke the implementation of "_find_paths()"_ that will be able to handle the real IMDd data that is shown at [`cr-find-paths-with-pruning.sql`](../../traversing-general-graphs/undirected-cyclic-graph/#cr-find-paths-with-pruning-sql). Invoke it _without_ early pruning:

```plpgsql
call find_paths('Emily', false);
```
Count the total number of paths that were found:

```plpgsql
select count(*) as "total number of paths" from raw_paths;
```

This is the result.

```
 total number of paths
-----------------------
                    44
```

Look at how many paths each next repeat adds:

```plpgsql
select repeat_nr, count(*) as number_of_paths
from raw_paths
group by repeat_nr
order by 1;
```

This is the result:

```
 repeat_nr | number_of_paths
-----------+-----------------
         0 |               2
         1 |               4
         2 |              10
         3 |              16
         4 |              12
```

If you're interested, inspect all forty-four paths thus:

```plpgsql
\t on
select t from list_paths('raw_paths');
\t off
```

Derive the shortest paths and inspect the result:

```plpgsql
call restrict_to_shortest_paths('raw_paths', 'shortest_paths');
\t on
select t from list_paths('shortest_paths');
\t off
```

This is the result:

```
 path #   cardinality   path
 ------   -----------   ----
      1             2   Emily > Chloe
      2             2   Emily > James
      3             3   Emily > Chloe > Alfie
      4             3   Emily > Chloe > Helen
      5             3   Emily > James > Steve
```

The five paths are highlighted in red here:

![undirected-cyclic-graph](/images/api/ysql/the-sql-language/with-clause/bacon-numbers/actors-movies-2.jpg)

Now invoke _"find_paths()"_ _with_ early pruning and confirm that the result is identical to that produced by invoking in _without_ early pruning and then deriving the shortest paths:

```plpgsql
call find_paths('Emily', true);
call assert_shortest_paths_same_as_raw_paths();
```

Derive the unique containing paths for these five paths:

```plpgsql
call restrict_to_unq_containing_paths('shortest_paths', 'unq_containing_paths');
select t from list_paths('unq_containing_paths');
```

This is the result:

```
 path #   cardinality   path
 ------   -----------   ----
      1             3   Emily > Chloe > Alfie
      2             3   Emily > Chloe > Helen
      3             3   Emily > James > Steve
```
The first result and the second result each contains _"Emily > Chloe"_ and the third contains _"Emily > James"_. So all five paths are accounted for.

## Decorate the path edges with the list of movies that brought each edge

Ensure that you have created the _"decorated_paths_report()"_ table function using the [`cr-decorated-paths-report.sql`](../../bacon-numbers/#cr-decorated-paths-report-sql) script. Invoke it thus to list all five decorated shortest paths:

```plpgsql
\t on
select t from decorated_paths_report('shortest_paths');
\t off
```

This is the result:

```
 --------------------------------------------------
 Emily
    Julius Caesar
    Merry Wives of Windsor
       Chloe
 --------------------------------------------------
 Emily
    As You Like It
    Coriolanus
    Othello
       James
 --------------------------------------------------
 Emily
    Julius Caesar
    Merry Wives of Windsor
       Chloe
          Hamlet
             Alfie
 --------------------------------------------------
 Emily
    Julius Caesar
    Merry Wives of Windsor
       Chloe
          Hamlet
          Romeo and Juliet
             Helen
 --------------------------------------------------
 Emily
    As You Like It
    Coriolanus
    Othello
       James
          King Lear
             Steve
 --------------------------------------------------
```

And invoke in thus to report the decorated path to Helen:

```plpgsql
\t on
select t from decorated_paths_report('shortest_paths', 'Helen');
\t off
```

This is the result:

```
 --------------------------------------------------
 Emily
    Julius Caesar
    Merry Wives of Windsor
       Chloe
          Hamlet
          Romeo and Juliet
             Helen
 --------------------------------------------------
```
