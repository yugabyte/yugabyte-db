## Synopsis

Use the `CREATE SCHEMA` statement to create a schema in the current database.
A schema is essentially a namespace: it contains named objects (tables, data types, functions, and operators) whose names can duplicate those of objects in other schemas.
Named objects in a schema can be accessed by using the schema name as prefix or by setting the schema name in the search path.

## Syntax

{{%ebnf%}}
  create_schema_name,
  create_schema_role,
  role_specification
{{%/ebnf%}}

Where

- `schema_name` is the name of the schema being created. If no schema_name is specified, the `role_name` is used. Schema names must not begin with `pg_`. The attempt to create a schema with such a name, or to rename an existing schema to have such a name, causes an error.

- `role_name` is the role who will own the new schema. If omitted, it defaults to the user executing the command. To create a schema owned by another role, you must be a direct or indirect member of that role, or be a superuser.

## Examples

- Create a schema.

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS branch;
```

- Create a schema for a user.

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# CREATE ROLE John;
yugabyte=# CREATE SCHEMA AUTHORIZATION john;
```

- Create a schema that will be owned by another role.

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# CREATE SCHEMA branch AUTHORIZATION john;
```
