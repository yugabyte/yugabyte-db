## Synopsis

Use the `DROP SERVER` command to remove a foreign server. The user who executes the command must be the owner of the foreign server.

## Syntax

{{%ebnf%}}
  drop_server
{{%/ebnf%}}

## Semantics

Drop a foreign server named **server_name**. If it doesnâ€™t exist in the database, an error will be thrown unless the `IF EXISTS` clause is used.

### RESTRICT/CASCADE:
`RESTRICT` is the default and it will not drop the foreign server if any objects depend on it.
`CASCADE` will drop the foreign server and any objects that transitively depend on it.

## Examples

Drop the foreign-data wrapper `my_server`, along with any objects that depend on it.

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# DROP SERVER my_server CASCADE;
```
