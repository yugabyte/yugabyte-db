## Configuration parameter

This term denotes parameters like _timezone_ that you can set, within the scope of a single session, and for no longer than the session's duration, with the _[set](../../../the-sql-language/statements/cmd_set/)_ statement. You observe the current value with the _[show](../../../the-sql-language/statements/cmd_show/)_ statement or the _[current_setting()](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/functions-admin.html#FUNCTIONS-ADMIN-SET)_ built-in function.

You can execute a _set_ statement in the source text of a subprogram's _[subprogram_implementation](../../../syntax_resources/grammar_diagrams/#subprogram-implementation)_. But you might prefer to make such a setting a property of the subprogram like this:

```plpgsql
drop function if exists f() cascade;
create function f()
  returns text
  set timezone = 'America/New_York'
  language sql
as $body$
  select current_setting('timezone');
$body$;

select f();
```

This is the result:

```output
        f
------------------
 America/New_York
```

It's useful to define a setting using a subprogram's configuration parameter when you want the value to remain in force for the duration of the callee subprogram's execution. The value of the setting that is in force just before the call is saved on entry. And then, when control returns to the caller, the saved value is restored. Because using a configuration parameter meets your requirement declaratively, doing this is preferred to writing your own code to save the caller's value on entry to the callee and to restore it on return to the caller. Here's an example: you want to lock the two rows that you'll change before changing either of them; you want to specify the value for _lock_timeout_; but you don't want the value that you set to endure .

```plpgsql
create table t(k int primary key, v int not null);
insert into t(k, v) values (17, 1234), (42, 5678);

create procedure p(k1 in int, k2 in int, a in int)
  set lock_timeout = 50
  language plpgsql
as $body$
begin
  raise info 'current lock_timeout: %', current_setting('lock_timeout');

  perform * from t where k in (k1, k2) for update;
  update t set v = v - a where k = k1;
  update t set v = v + a where k = k2;
end;
$body$;

set lock_timeout = 0;
call p(17, 42, 9999);
show lock_timeout;
```

## Security

The _security_ attribute determines the identity of the effective _role_ (as is observed with the _[current_role](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/functions-info.html#FUNCTIONS-INFO-SESSION-TABLE)_ built-in function) with which SQL issued by a subprogram executes. The allowed values are _definer_ and _invoker_. The default is _invoker_.

- A _security definer_ subprogram executes with the privileges of the subprogram's owner. The general use-case is to allow a low-privileged invoking role to execute specific intended actions that require privileges (or role attributes) that the invoker does not possess.
- A _security invoker_ subprogram executes with the privileges of the _[session_user](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/functions-info.html#FUNCTIONS-INFO-SESSION-TABLE)_.

It's important to understand how unqualified names in SQL statements in a subprogram's implementation are resolved. This is explained in the section [Name resolution within anonymous blocks and user-defined subprograms](../../name-resolution-in-subprograms/).

Try the following demonstration. It connects to the database _demo_ and relies on two roles, _u1_ (which owns the schema called _u1_) and _u2_ (which doesn't need to own a schema).

First connect as _u1_ and create the artifacts that the demonstration needs:

```plpgsql
\c demo u1
grant usage on schema u1 to u2;

drop table if exists u1.t cascade;
drop function if exists u1.security_definer_result(int) cascade;
drop function if exists u1.security_invoker_result(int) cascade;

create table u1.t(k int primary key, v text not null);
insert into  u1.t(k, v) values(42, 'Selected value of "v" in "u1.t"');

create function u1.security_definer_result(k_in in int)
  returns table(z text)
  language plpgsql
  security definer
as $body$
begin
  z := 'session_user: '||session_user;          return next;
  z := 'current_role: '||current_role;          return next;
  z := (select v from u1.t where k = k_in);     return next;
end;
$body$;

grant execute on function security_definer_result(int) to u2;

create function u1.security_invoker_result(k_in in int)
  returns table(z text)
  security invoker
  language plpgsql
as $body$
begin
  z := 'session_user: '||session_user;                               return next;
  z := 'current_role: '||current_role;                               return next;
  z := (select v from u1.t where k = k_in);                          return next;
exception
  when insufficient_privilege then
    z := current_role||' has no privilege to select from u1.t';      return next;
end;
$body$;

grant execute on function security_invoker_result(int) to u2;
```

Now connect as _u2_ to see the behavior difference between a subprogram that has _security definer_ and one that has _security invoker_:

```plpgsql
\c demo u2

select u1.security_definer_result(42);
select u1.security_invoker_result(42);
```

This is the result:

```output
   security_definer_result
---------------------------------
 session_user: u2
 current_role: u1
 Selected value of "v" in "u1.t"

       security_invoker_result
-----------------------------------------
 session_user: u2
 current_role: u2
 u2 has no privilege to select from u1.t
```

{{< tip title="The optional 'external' keyword is allowed just for SQL conformance." >}}
Unlike in some SQL systems, _external_ applies to all functionsâ€”and not just to external ones. So it actually has no effect. Yugabyte therefore recommends that you omit it.
