### Grammar

```ebnf
delete ::= DELETE FROM table_name
               [ USING TIMESTAMP timestamp_expression ] WHERE
               where_expression [ IF { [ NOT ] EXISTS | if_expression } ]
               [ RETURNS STATUS AS ROW ]
```

Where

- `table_name` is an identifier (possibly qualified with a keyspace name).
- Restrictions on `where_expression` and `if_expression` are covered in the Semantics section.
- See [Expressions](..#expressions) for more information on syntax rules.

## Semantics

- An error is raised if the specified `table_name` does not exist.
- The `where_expression` and `if_expression` must evaluate to [boolean](../type_bool) values.
- The `USING TIMESTAMP` clause indicates you would like to perform the DELETE as if it was done at the
  timestamp provided by the user. The timestamp is the number of microseconds since epoch.
- **Note**: You should either use the `USING TIMESTAMP` clause in all of your statements or none of
   them. Using a mix of statements where some have `USING TIMESTAMP` and others do not will lead to
   very confusing results.
- `DELETE` is always done at `QUORUM` consistency level irrespective of setting.

### WHERE Clause

- The `where_expression` must specify conditions for all primary-key columns.
- The `where_expression` must not specify conditions for any regular columns.
- The `where_expression` can only apply `AND` and `=` operators. Other operators are not yet supported.

### IF Clause

- The `if_expression` can only apply to non-key columns (regular columns).
- The `if_expression` can contain any logical and boolean operators.
- Deleting only some column values from a row is not yet supported.
- `IF EXISTS` and `IF NOT EXISTS` options are mostly for symmetry with the [`INSERT`](../dml_insert) and [`UPDATE`](../dml_update/) commands.
  - `IF EXISTS` works like a normal delete but additionally returns whether the delete was applied (a row was found with that primary key).
  - `IF NOT EXISTS` is effectively a no-op since rows that do not exist cannot be deleted (but returns whether no row was found with that primary key).

### `USING` Clause

The `timestamp_expression` must be an integer value (or a bind variable marker for prepared statements).

## Examples

### Delete a row from a table

```sql
ycqlsh:example> CREATE TABLE employees(department_id INT,
                                      employee_id INT,
                                      name TEXT,
                                      PRIMARY KEY(department_id, employee_id));
```

```sql
ycqlsh:example> INSERT INTO employees(department_id, employee_id, name) VALUES (1, 1, 'John');
```

```sql
ycqlsh:example> INSERT INTO employees(department_id, employee_id, name) VALUES (1, 2, 'Jane');
```

```sql
ycqlsh:example> INSERT INTO employees(department_id, employee_id, name) VALUES (2, 1, 'Joe');
```

```sql
ycqlsh:example> SELECT * FROM employees;
```

```output
 department_id | employee_id | name
---------------+-------------+------
             1 |           1 | John
             1 |           2 | Jane
             2 |           1 |  Joe
```

Delete statements identify rows by the primary key columns.

```sql
ycqlsh:example> DELETE FROM employees WHERE department_id = 1 AND employee_id = 1;
```

Deletes on non-existent rows are no-ops.

```sql
ycqlsh:example> DELETE FROM employees WHERE department_id = 3 AND employee_id = 1;
```

```sql
ycqlsh:example> SELECT * FROM employees;
```

```output
 department_id | employee_id | name
---------------+-------------+------
             1 |           2 | Jane
             2 |           1 |  Joe
```

### Conditional delete using the `IF` clause

'IF' clause conditions will return whether they were applied or not.

```sql
ycqlsh:example> DELETE FROM employees WHERE department_id = 2 AND employee_id = 1 IF name = 'Joe';
```

```output
 [applied]
-----------
      True
```

```sql
ycqlsh:example> DELETE FROM employees WHERE department_id = 3 AND employee_id = 1 IF EXISTS;
```

```output
 [applied]
-----------
     False
```

```sql
ycqlsh:example> SELECT * FROM employees;
```

```output
 department_id | employee_id | name
---------------+-------------+------
             1 |           2 | Jane
```

### Delete several rows with the same partition key

```sql
ycqlsh:example> INSERT INTO employees(department_id, employee_id, name) VALUES (1, 1, 'John');
```

```sql
ycqlsh:example> INSERT INTO employees(department_id, employee_id, name) VALUES (2, 1, 'Joe');
```

```sql
ycqlsh:example> INSERT INTO employees(department_id, employee_id, name) VALUES (2, 2, 'Jack');
```

```sql
ycqlsh:example> SELECT * FROM employees;
```

```output
 department_id | employee_id | name
---------------+-------------+------
             1 |           1 | John
             1 |           2 | Jane
             2 |           1 |  Joe
             2 |           2 | Jack
```

Delete all entries for a partition key.

```sql
ycqlsh:example> DELETE FROM employees WHERE department_id = 1;
```

```sql
ycqlsh:example> SELECT * FROM employees;
```

```output
 department_id | employee_id | name
---------------+-------------+------
             2 |           1 |  Joe
             2 |           2 | Jack
```

Delete a range of entries within a partition key.

```sql
ycqlsh:example> DELETE FROM employees WHERE department_id = 2 AND employee_id >= 2 AND employee_id < 4;
```

```sql
ycqlsh:example> SELECT * FROM employees;
```

```output
 department_id | employee_id | name
---------------+-------------+------
             2 |           1 |  Joe
```

### Delete with the `USING TIMESTAMP` clause

You can do this as follows:

```sql
ycqlsh:foo> INSERT INTO employees(department_id, employee_id, name) VALUES (4, 4, 'Ted') USING TIMESTAMP 1000;
```

```sql
ycqlsh:foo> SELECT * FROM employees;
```

```output
 department_id | employee_id | name
---------------+-------------+------
             4 |           4 |  Ted
             2 |           1 |  Joe

(2 rows)
```

```sql
ycqlsh:foo> DELETE FROM employees USING TIMESTAMP 500 WHERE department_id = 4 AND employee_id = 4;
```

Not applied since timestamp is lower than 1000

```sql
ycqlsh:foo> SELECT * FROM employees;
```

```output
 department_id | employee_id | name
---------------+-------------+------
             4 |           4 |  Ted
             2 |           1 |  Joe

(2 rows)
```

```sql
ycqlsh:foo> DELETE FROM employees USING TIMESTAMP 1500 WHERE department_id = 4 AND employee_id = 4;
```

Applied since timestamp is higher than 1000.

```sql
ycqlsh:foo> SELECT * FROM employees;
```

```output
 department_id | employee_id | name
---------------+-------------+------
             2 |           1 |  Joe

(1 rows)
```

### RETURNS STATUS AS ROW

When executing a batch in YCQL, the protocol returns only one error or return status. The `RETURNS STATUS AS ROW` feature addresses this limitation and adds a status row for each statement.

See examples in [batch docs](../batch#row-status).
