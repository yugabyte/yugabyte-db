A distributed SQL database needs to automatically split the data in a table and distribute it across nodes. This is known as data sharding and it can be achieved through different strategies, each with its own tradeoffs. YugabyteDB's sharding architecture is inspired by <a href="https://research.google.com/archive/spanner-osdi2012.pdf">Google Spanner</a>.

## Sharding

YugabyteDB splits table data into smaller pieces called [tablets a.k.a shards](../key-concepts/#tablet). Sharding is the process of mapping of a row of a table to a shard. Sharding helps in scalability and geo-distribution by horizontally partitioning data. These shards are distributed across multiple server nodes (containers, virtual machines, bare-metal) in a shared-nothing architecture. The application interacts with a SQL table as one logical unit and remains agnostic to the physical placement of the shards. DocDB supports range and hash sharding natively.

## Tablet splitting

As table data grows, the size of tablets increase. Once a tablet reaches a threshold size, it automatically splits into two. These 2 new tablets can now be placed in other nodes to keep the load on the system balanced. Tablet splitting is one of the foundations of [scaling](../../explore/linear-scalability).
