For applications that have to be run in multiple regions, you can adopt the **Active-Active Multi-Master** pattern, where you set up two clusters in two different regions, and both clusters actively take responsibility for local reads and writes and replicate data **asynchronously**. In this case, failover is manual and incurs possible loss of data, as the data is asynchronously replicated between the two clusters, but both reads and writes have low latencies.

Application instances are active in multiple regions and may read stale data.

## Overview

{{<cluster-setup-tabs list="local,anywhere">}}

Suppose you have cluster with a replication factor of 3, and applications deployed in `us-west`.

This ensures that the reads and writes are in the same region, with the expected low latencies. Because the entire cluster is in a single region, in case of a region failure, you would lose all the data.

## Multi-master

You can eliminate the possibility of data loss by setting up another cluster in a different region, say `us-east`, using [xCluster](../../../explore/going-beyond-sql/asynchronous-replication-ysql/#configure-bidirectional-replication).

The `us-east` cluster is independent of the primary cluster in `us-west` and the data is populated by **asynchronous replication**. This means that the read and write latencies of each cluster are not affected by the other, but at the same time, the data in each cluster is not immediately consistent with the other. You can use this pattern to reduce latencies for local users.

## Transactional consistency

The **Active-Active Multi-Master** pattern does not guarantee any transactional consistency during the replication between the clusters. Conflicts are resolved in the bi-directional replication by adopting the "last-writer wins" strategy.

## Failover

When one of the clusters fails, say `us-west`, the other cluster in `us-east` can handle reads and writes for all applications until the failed region recovers.

## Caveats

The replication happens at the DocDB layer, bypassing the query layer, and some standard functionality doesn't work:

- Avoid `UNIQUE` indexes and constraints, as there is no way to check uniqueness.
- Avoid `TRIGGERS`, as the triggers won't be fired as the query layer is bypassed.
- Avoid `SERIAL` columns as both the clusters would generate the same sequence (use UUID instead).
- Schema changes are not automatically transmitted but have to be applied manually (currently).
- Transaction updates are NOT committed atomically across sources and hence the other cluster could be transactionally inconsistent.
