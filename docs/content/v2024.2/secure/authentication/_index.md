Authentication is the process by which the database server establishes the identity of the client, and by extension determines whether the client application (or the user who runs the client application) is permitted to connect with the database user name that was requested. YugabyteDB offers a number of different client authentication methods. The method used to authenticate a particular client connection can be selected on the basis of (client) host address, database, and user.

The authentication methods do not require any external security infrastructure and are the quickest way for YugabyteDB DBAs to secure the database. Password authentication is the easiest choice for authenticating remote user connections.
