Like PostgreSQL, YugabyteDB provides security in multiple ways:

* **Authentication** - limit access to the database to clients with proper credentials

* **Authorization** - create users and roles, and grant privileges to restrict activities that the users and roles can perform

* **Encryption** - encrypt the database, as well as all network communication between servers

* **Auditing** - conduct session- and object-level auditing

* **Network access restriction** - limit connections to the database using RPC binding

## Authentication

Using client authentication, you can define how the database server establishes the identity of the client, and whether the client application (or the user who runs the client application) is allowed to connect with the database user name that was requested. YugabyteDB offers a number of different client authentication methods, all of which can be configured using the YB-TServer [`--ysql_hba_conf_csv`](../../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#ysql-hba-conf-csv) configuration flag.

The methods include the following:

* **Password** - authenticate using MD5 or SCRAM-SHA-256.

  MD5 is the default password encryption for YugabyteDB clusters. To set SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication, you must set the YB-TServer `--ysql_hba_conf_csv` flag to `scram-sha-256`.

* **LDAP** - use external LDAP services to perform client authentication.

* **Host-based** - authenticate local and remote clients based on IP address and using TLS certificates.

  The default YugabyteDB `listen_addresses` setting accepts connections only from localhost. To allow remote connections, you must add client authentication records to the YB-TServer `--ysql_hba_conf_csv` flag.

* **Trust** - authorize specific local connections. `trust` authentication is used by default.

You can choose the method to use to authenticate a particular client connection based on the client host address, the database they are connecting to, and user credentials.

YugabyteDB stores authentication credentials internally in the YB-Master system tables. The authentication mechanisms available to clients depend on what is supported and exposed by the YSQL and YCQL APIs.

## Authorization

YugabyteDB provides role-based access control (RBAC), consisting of a collection of privileges on resources given to roles.

### Roles

Roles are essential for implementing and administering access control on a YugabyteDB cluster. Roles can represent individual users or a group of users, and encapsulate a set of privileges that can be assigned to other roles (or users). You can modify roles to grant users or applications the minimum required privileges based on the operations they need to perform against the database. Typically, you create an administrator role first, and the administrator then creates additional roles for users.

For example, to create a role `engineering` for an engineering team in an organization, do the following:

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# CREATE ROLE engineering;
```

Roles that have `LOGIN` privileges are users. So to create a user `john`, do the following:

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# CREATE ROLE john LOGIN PASSWORD 'PasswdForJohn';
```

You can then grant the `engineering` role to the user `john` as follows:

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# GRANT engineering TO john;
```

### Privileges

You grant privileges explicitly to roles to access objects in the database using the `GRANT` statement. You can, for example, assign read access to one role, data modify access to another role, and alter table access to a third.

By default, only the owner has privileges on new objects; you must grant privileges to other roles explicitly.

For example, if you want all members of engineering to be able to read data from a table called `integration_tests`, you would use the `GRANT` statement to grant `SELECT` (or read) access to the `engineering` role. This can be done as follows:

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLE integration_tests to engineering;
yugabyte=# GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA public TO engineering;
```

You can verify that the `engineering` role has `SELECT` privileges as follows:

```sql
yugabyte=# \z
```

The output should look similar to below, where you see that the `engineering` role has `SELECT` privileges on the `data` resource.

```output
 Schema |       Name        | Type  |     Access privileges     | Column privileges | Policies
--------+-------------------+-------+---------------------------+-------------------+----------
 public | integration_tests | table | yugabyte=arwdDxt/yugabyte+|                   |
        |                   |       | engineering=r/yugabyte   +|                   |
```

The access privileges "arwdDxt" include all privileges for the user `yugabyte` (superuser), while the role `engineering` has only "r" (read) privileges. For details on the `GRANT` statement, refer to [GRANT](../../../api/ysql/the-sql-language/statements/dcl_grant).

### Row-level access

In addition to database access permissions available through the `ROLE` and `GRANT` privilege system, YugabyteDB provides a more granular level of security where tables can have row security policies that restrict the rows that users can access.

Row-level Security (RLS) restricts rows that can be returned by normal queries or inserted, updated, or deleted by DML commands. RLS policies can be created specific to a `DML` command or with `ALL` commands. They can also be used to create policies on a particular role or multiple roles.

By default, tables do not have any RLS policies defined, so that if a user has access privileges to a table, all rows within the table are available to query and update.

RLS policies are defined for tables using the `ALTER TABLE` statement. For example:

```sql
yugabyte=# ALTER TABLE employees ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

### Column-level access

You can use column-level security in YugabyteDB to restrict users to viewing only a particular column or set of columns in a table. You do this by creating a view that includes only the columns that the user needs access to using the `CREATE VIEW` command, and then grant privileges to roles for the view. For example:

```sql
yugabyte=# CREATE VIEW emp_info as select empno, ename, address from emploees;
yugabyte=# GRANT SELECT on emp_info to ybadmin;
```

This creates a view called `emp_info` with three columns from the table `employees`, and grants access to the `ybadmin` role.

## Encryption

YugabyteDB supports both encryption in transit (that is, the network communication between servers), and encryption at rest (that is, encryption of the database itself). Yugabyte further provides column-level encryption to protect sensitive data in tables.

### Encryption in transit

[TLS encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security) ensures that network communication between servers is secure. You can configure YugabyteDB to use TLS to encrypt intra-cluster and client to server network communication. Servers are secured using TLS certificates, which can be from a public CA or self-signed.

You should enable encryption in transit for YugabyteDB clusters and clients to ensure privacy and the integrity of data transferred over the network.

Server-to-server encryption is enabled using the `--use_node_to_node_encryption` flag.

Client-to-server encryption requires that server-to-server encryption be enabled, and is enabled using the `--use_client_to_server_encryption` flag.

### Encryption at rest

[Encryption at rest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_at_rest#Encryption) ensures that data at rest (that is, stored on disk), is protected. You can configure YugabyteDB with a user-generated symmetric key to perform cluster-wide encryption.

### Column-level encryption

YugabyteDB provides column-level encryption to restrict access to sensitive data such as addresses and credit card details. YugabyteDB uses the PostgreSQL `pgcrypto` extension to enable column level encryption. The `PGP_SYM_ENCRYPT` and `PGP_SYM_DECRYPT` functions of `pgcrypto` are used to encrypt and decrypt column data.

To encrypt column data, you use the `PGP_SYM_ENCRYPT` function when inserting data into a table. For example:

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# INSERT INTO employees VALUES (1, 'joe', '56 grove st',  20000, PGP_SYM_ENCRYPT('AC-22001', 'AES_KEY'));
```

## Auditing

Use audit logging to produce audit logs needed to comply with government, financial, or ISO certifications. YugabyteDB YSQL uses the PostgreSQL Audit Extension (pgaudit) to provide detailed session and object audit logging via YugabyteDB YB-TServer logging.

You enable audit logging using the `--ysql_pg_conf_csv` YB-TServer flag.

### Session logging

Session logging is enabled on a per user session basis. You can enable session logging for all `DML` and `DDL` statements and log all relations in `DML` statements.

For example, to enable session-level audit logging for all `DDL` statements for a YugabyteDB cluster:

```sql
yugabyte=# SET pgaudit.log = 'read, ddl';
```

{{<lead link="../../../secure/audit-logging/session-audit-logging-ysql/">}}
Learn about [Session-Level Audit Logging in YSQL](../../../secure/audit-logging/session-audit-logging-ysql/).
{{</lead>}}

### Object logging

Object logging logs statements that affect a particular relation, and is intended to be a finer-grained replacement for session-level logging. It may not make sense to use them in conjunction, but you could for example use session logging to capture each statement and then supplement that with object logging to get more detail about specific relations.

YugabyteDB implements object-level audit logging by reusing the PostgreSQL role system. The `pgaudit.role` setting defines the role that will be used for audit logging. A relation (such as `TABLE` or `VIEW`) will be audit logged when the audit role has permissions for the command executed or inherits the permissions from another role. This allows you to effectively have multiple audit roles even though there is a single master role in any context.

For example, to enable object logging for the `auditor` role:

```sql
yugabyte=# SET pgaudit.role = 'auditor';
```

## Restrict network access

Ensure that YugabyteDB runs in a trusted network environment, such that:

* Servers running YugabyteDB services are directly accessible only by the servers running the application and database administrators.

* Only servers running applications can connect to YugabyteDB services on the RPC ports. Access to the [YugabyteDB ports](../../../reference/configuration/default-ports/) should be denied to all others.

In addition, you can limit the interfaces on which YugabyteDB instances listen for incoming connections. To specify just the required interfaces when starting yb-master and yb-tserver, use the `--rpc_bind_addresses` YB-TServer flag. Do not bind to the loopback address.
