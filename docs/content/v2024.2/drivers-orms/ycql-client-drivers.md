The following client drivers are supported for use with the [YugabyteDB Cloud Query Language (YCQL) API](../../api/ycql/), a SQL-based, semi-relational API, with roots in the Apache Cassandra Query Language (CQL).

For tutorials on building a sample application with the following client drivers, click the relevant link included below for each driver.

{{< note title="Use YugabyteDB client drivers" >}}
You should always use the YugabyteDB YCQL client drivers. Using generic Cassandra drivers can lead to errors and performance issues.
