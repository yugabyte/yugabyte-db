Migrating to YugabyteDB, a high-performance distributed SQL database, involves a series of carefully planned steps to ensure a seamless transition from your existing database environment, such as PostgreSQL, to a scalable, fault-tolerant, and globally distributed system. Whether you're moving from a monolithic setup or another distributed system, understanding the migration strategies, tools, and best practices is crucial to achieving a successful migration.

## YugabyteDB Voyager

Yugabyte ships [YugabyteDB Voyager](/preview/yugabyte-voyager/), a comprehensive data migration tool designed specifically to help users migrate from traditional databases like PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL, and others to YugabyteDB. It offers a variety of features that make the migration process smoother, more reliable, and less error-prone.

## Export your data

If you need to export your data manually, you can use the [ysql_dump](../../admin/ysql-dump/) tool or use the [COPY TO](../../api/ysql/the-sql-language/statements/cmd_copy/) command to export your tables into CSV files.

## Import your data

To import data into a YSQL database manually, you can use [ysqlsh](../../api/ysqlsh/) tool or use the [COPY FROM](../../api/ysql/the-sql-language/statements/cmd_copy/) command to import CSV files into YugabyteDB.

## Verify migration

After the data has been imported into the newly set up YugabyteDB cluster, you need to verify and validate that the data and the schema have been migrated correctly to ensure smooth functioning of your services.
