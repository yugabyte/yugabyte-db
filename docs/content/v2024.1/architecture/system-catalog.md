System catalogs, also known as system tables or system views, play a crucial role in the internal organization and management of the database and serve as the backbone of YugabyteDB's architecture. YugabyteDB builds upon the system catalog of [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalogs.html). These catalogs form a centralized repository that stores metadata about the database itself, such as tables, indexes, columns, constraints, functions, users, privileges, extensions, query statistics, and more. All the system catalog tables and views are organized under the _pg_catalog_ schema.

To list the tables in the system catalog, you can execute the following command:

```sql
SELECT tablename FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables WHERE schemaname='pg_catalog';
```

To list all the views in the system catalog, you can execute the following command:

```sql
SELECT viewname FROM pg_catalog.pg_views WHERE schemaname='pg_catalog';
```

To get the details of the names and type information of columns in a table, you can run the following command:

```sql
\d+ <table-name>
```

## Information schema

In most cases, developers and applications interact with _information_schema_ for querying database metadata in a portable manner, while pg_catalog is primarily used for advanced PostgreSQL administration and troubleshooting tasks.

_information_schema_ provides a standardized, SQL-compliant view of database metadata that is portable across different database systems and is defined in the [SQL standard](https://www.iso.org/standard/76586.html), while pg_catalog offers detailed, PostgreSQL-specific system catalogs for internal database operations and management.

Let's look at some of the important information that can be fetched using the system catalog tables and views, followed by a summary of other members.

## Schema

The schema details of the various database objects are stored in multiple tables as follows.

- _pg_database_ : stores the list of all the databases in the system
- _pg_namespace_ : stores metadata about schemas, including schema names, owner information, and associated privileges.
- _pg_class_ : stores metadata about all relations (tables, views, indexes, sequences, and other relation types) in the database.
- _pg_attribute_ : stores information about the columns (attributes) of all relations (tables, views, indexes, and so on) in the database.
- _pg_index_ : stores detailed metadata about indexes, including details such as the indexed columns, index types, and index properties like uniqueness and inclusion of nullable values.
- _pg_constraint_ : stores information about constraints on tables. These can include unique constraints, check constraints, primary key constraints, and foreign key constraints.

This information is typically fetched using convenient views, such as the following:

- _pg_views_ : provides details on views and their definitions.
- _pg_tables_ : provides details on tables, their ownership, and basic properties (for example, if the table has any indexes).
- `information_schema.tables` : provides table information as per SQL standard.
- `information_schema.columns` : provides column information as per SQL standard.
- `information_schema.views` : provides view information as per SQL standard.

## Settings

The _pg_settings_ view provides a centralized location for retrieving information about current configuration settings, including database-related parameters and their respective values. It is essentially an alternative interface to the SHOW and SET commands. These parameters can be changed at server start, reload, session, or transaction level. _pg_settings_ allows administrators and developers to inspect runtime settings, such as memory allocation, logging options, connection limits, and performance-related parameters.

{{<note>}}
The pg_settings view isn't based on underlying tables. Instead, it retrieves information from a combination of sources including the server configuration file, command-line arguments, environment variables, and internal data structures.
{{</note>}}

## Session activity

The _pg_stat_activity_ view shows detailed information about active sessions, including process IDs, application names, client addresses, and the SQL statements being executed. This is used to monitor database performance, identify long-running or blocked queries, and diagnose concurrency issues.

{{<note>}}
The pg_stat_activity view is not based on any specific tables. Instead, it provides real-time information about the current activity of each session based on internal data structures. This includes information such as the user, current query, state of the query (active, idle, and more), and other session-level information.

## Table activity

The _pg_stat_all_tables_ and _pg_stat_user_tables_ views provide insights into various table-level metrics, including the number of rows inserted, updated, deleted, and accessed via sequential or index scans. It enables administrators to assess table-level activity, identify high-traffic tables, and optimize database performance based on usage patterns.

## Locks

The _pg_locks_ view provides detailed information about current locks held by active transactions, including lock types (for example, shared, exclusive), lock modes, and the associated database objects being locked. This view can be used to monitor lock escalation, detect long-running transactions holding locks, and optimize transactions to minimize lock contention and improve database concurrency.

{{<note>}}
The pg_locks view doesn't have a documented view definition that you can directly inspect in the database. This is because the view definition relies on internal data structures used by the lock manager, and these structures aren't intended for direct user access.
{{</note>}}

{{<tip>}}
[pg_locks](#pg-locks) view can be joined to [pg_stat_activity](#pg-stat-activity) view on the _pid_ column to get more information on the session holding or awaiting each lock.

## Stored procedures

The _pg_proc_ catalog stores metadata about database procedures, including their names, argument types, return types, source code, and associated permissions. It enables developers and administrators to inspect function definitions, review function dependencies, and monitor usage statistics to optimize query performance and database operations.

- _pg_stat_user_functions_ : provides statistics on execution details on stored procedures (for example, number of calls, execution time spent).
- `information_schema.routines` view provides great detail about stored procedures from multiple tables.

## Query performance

The _pg_stat_statements_ view provides detailed statistical insights into SQL query performance by tracking query execution statistics over time. It records metrics such as query execution counts, total runtime, average runtime, and resource consumption (for example, CPU time, I/O) for individual SQL statements. Using _pg_stat_statements_, you can prioritize optimization efforts based on query frequency and resource consumption, improving overall database efficiency and response times.

{{<note>}}
By default, only _min_, _max_, _mean_, and _stddev_ of the execution times are associated with a query. This has proved insufficient to debug large volumes of queries. To get a better insight, YugabyteDB introduces an additional column, [yb_latency_histogram](../../explore/query-1-performance/pg-stat-statements#yb-latency-histogram-column), that stores a list of latency ranges and the number of query executions in that range.

## Data statistics

The statistics about the table data are stored in the _pg_statistic_ table. For efficiency, this data is not updated on the fly so it may not be up to date. This data can be updated by running the `ANALYZE` command. This table stores column-level information about the number of distinct values, most common values, their frequencies, and so on. This data is very useful for query tuning. The _pg_stats_ view provides user-friendly information by joining other tables with the _pg_statistic_ table.

## Users and roles

The `pg_authid` table stores details of users, roles, groups, and the corresponding privileges, such as whether the user is a superuser, the user can create a database, and so on. The membership of users to groups and roles is stored in the `pg_auth_members` table. This information is usually queried using the following views:

- _pg_roles_: stores metadata about database roles, including role names, privileges, membership, and login capabilities.
- _pg_user_: Information specific to database users, including user name, password, and privileges.
