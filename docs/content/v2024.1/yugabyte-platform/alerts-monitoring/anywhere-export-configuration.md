You can export universe logs to third-party tools for analysis and customization. Exporting data is a two-stage process:

1. Create an export configuration. A configuration defines the sign in credentials and settings for the tool that you want to export to.
1. Use the configuration to export logs from a universe. While the connection is active, logs are automatically streamed to the tool.

Currently, you can export data to the following tools:

- [Datadog](https://docs.datadoghq.com/)
- [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/solutions/opentelemetry.html)
- [AWS CloudWatch](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/WhatIsCloudWatch.html)
- [GCP Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/)

For information on how to export logs from a universe using an export configuration, refer to [Export logs](../universe-logging/).

## Prerequisites

Export configuration is {{<tags/feature/ea>}}. To enable export configuration management, set the **Enable DB Audit Logging** Global Configuration option (config key `yb.universe.audit_logging_enabled`) to true. Refer to [Manage runtime configuration settings](../../administer-yugabyte-platform/manage-runtime-config/). Note that only a Super Admin user can modify Global configuration settings. The flag can't be turned off if audit logging is enabled on a universe.

## Best practices

- To limit performance impact and control costs, locate export configurations in a region close to your universe(s).

## Configure integrations

Create and manage export configurations on the **Integrations > Log** page.

<!--![Export configurations](/images/yp/export-configurations.png)-->

The page lists the configured and available third-party integrations.

### Manage integrations

You can add and delete export configurations for the following tools. You can't delete a configuration that is in use by a universe.
