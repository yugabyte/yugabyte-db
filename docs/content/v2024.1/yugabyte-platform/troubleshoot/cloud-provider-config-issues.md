Typically, the failure is caused by your subscription not having enough quota on Azure to create the specific size VM cores in a specific region. To resolve the issue, increase the quota limit by following instructions provided in [Increase VM-family vCPU quotas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/per-vm-quota-requests).
