The YugabyteDB release that is powering a universe can be upgraded to get new features and fixes included in the release.

{{< note title="Upgrading YugabyteDB on deprecated operating systems" >}}

If your universe is running on a [deprecated OS](../../../reference/configuration/operating-systems/), you will need to update your OS before you can upgrade to the next major YugabyteDB release. Refer to [Patch and upgrade the Linux operating system](../upgrade-nodes/).

{{< /note >}}

When performing a database upgrade, do the following:

1. [Upgrade YugabyteDB Anywhere](../../upgrade/). You cannot upgrade a universe to a version of YugabyteDB that is later than the version of YugabyteDB Anywhere.

    For information on which versions of YugabyteDB are compatible with your version of YugabyteDB Anywhere, refer to [Compatibility with YugabyteDB](/preview/releases/yba-releases/#compatibility-with-yugabytedb).

1. [Prepare to upgrade a universe](../upgrade-software-prepare/). Depending on the upgrade you are planning, you may need to make changes to your automation or upgrade your Linux operating system.

1. [View and import releases](../ybdb-releases/). Before you can upgrade your universe to a specific version of YugabyteDB, verify that the release is available in YugabyteDB Anywhere and, if necessary, import the release.

1. [Upgrade the universe](../upgrade-software-install/). Perform a rolling upgrade on a live universe deployment.
