Before you can deploy universes to VMware Tanzu using YugabyteDB Anywhere (YBA), you must create a provider configuration.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure that you have created the [kubeconfig file](../../prepare/cloud-permissions/cloud-permissions-nodes/#create-a-kubeconfig-file) so YBA can use the provided credentials to automatically provision and deprovision Kubernetes pods that run the YugabyteDB universe.

## Configure TKG

To configure any TKG edition (that is, either TKG-Integrated, TKG-Service, or TKG-Multicloud), navigate to **Integrations > Infrastructure > VMware Tanzu**.

This lists all currently configured VMware Tanzu providers.

To create a TKG provider, click **Create Kubernetes Config**. For more information, refer to [Create a provider](../kubernetes/#create-a-provider).

### Provider settings

Set the **Kubernetes Provider Type** to VMWare Tanzu.

For information on the Kubernetes Provider settings, refer to [Provider settings](../kubernetes/#provider-settings).

To add service-level annotations, use the following [overrides](../kubernetes/#overrides):

```yaml
serviceEndpoints:
  - name: "yb-master-service"
    type: "LoadBalancer"
    annotations:
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal: "0.0.0.0/0"
    app: "yb-master"
    ports:
      ui: "7000"

  - name: "yb-tserver-service"
    type: "LoadBalancer"
    annotations:
      service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-internal: "0.0.0.0/0"
    app: "yb-tserver"
    ports:
      ycql-port: "9042"
      ysql-port: "5433"
```

To disable LoadBalancer, use the following overrides:

```yaml
enableLoadBalancer: False
```

To change the cluster domain name, use the following overrides:

```yaml
domainName: my.cluster
```

To add annotations at the StatefulSet level, use the following overrides:

```yaml
networkAnnotation:
  annotation1: 'foo'
  annotation2: 'bar'
```

## Appendix: VMware Tanzu application service

VMware Tanzu Application Service is no longer actively supported and the following information is considered legacy.

If you choose to use VMware Tanzu Application Service, before creating the service instance, ensure that the following is available:

- The YugabyteDB tile is installed in your PCF marketplace.
- The cloud provider is configured in the YBA instance in your PCF environment.

### Create a YugabyteDB service instance

You can create a YugabyteDB service instance via the App Manager UI or Cloud Foundry (cf) command-line interface (CLI).

#### Use the PCF app manager

- In your PCF App manager, navigate to the marketplace and select **YugabyteDB**.
- Read descriptions of the available service plans to identify the resource requirements and intended environment, as shown in the following illustration:

  ![Yugabyte Service Plans](/images/deploy/pivotal-cloud-foundry/service-plan-choices.png)

- Select the service plan.
- Complete the service instance configuration, as shown in the following illustration:

  ![App Manager Configuration](/images/deploy/pivotal-cloud-foundry/apps-manager-config.png)

#### Use the cloud foundry CLI

You can view the marketplace and plan description in the cf CLI by executing the following command:

```sh
cf marketplace -s yugabyte-db
```

The output should be similar to the following:

```output
service plan   description                  free or paid
x-small        Cores: 2, Memory (GB): 4     paid
small          Cores: 4, Memory (GB): 7     paid
medium         Cores: 8, Memory (GB): 15    paid
large          Cores: 16, Memory (GB): 15   paid
x-large        Cores: 32, Memory (GB): 30   paid
```

After you decide on the service plan, you can launch the YugabyteDB service instance by executing the following command:

```sh
cf create-service yugabyte-db x-small yb-demo -c '{"universe_name": "yb-demo"}'
```

### Configure the YugabyteDB service instance

You can specify override options when you create a service instance using the YugabyteDB service broker.

#### Override cloud providers

Depending on the cloud providers configured for your YBA, you can create Yugabyte service instances by providing overrides.

To provision in AWS or GCP cloud, your overrides should include the appropriate `provider_type` and `region_codes` as an array, as follows:

```yaml
{
 "universe_name": "cloud-override-demo",
 "provider_type": "gcp", # gcp for Google Cloud, aws for Amazon Web Service
 "region_codes": ["us-west1"] # comma delimited list of regions
}
```

To provision in Kubernetes, your overrides should include the appropriate `provider_type` and `kube_provider` type, as follows:

```yaml
{
 "universe_name": "cloud-override-demo",
 "provider_type": "kubernetes",
 "kube_provider": "gke" # gke for Google Compute Engine, pks for Pivotal Container Service (default)
}
```

#### Override the number of nodes

To override the number of nodes, include the `num_nodes` with the desired value, and then include this parameter along with other parameters for the cloud provider, as follows:

```yaml
{
 "universe_name": "cloud-override-demo",
 "num_nodes": 4 # default is 3 nodes.
}
```

#### Override the replication factor

To override the replication factor, include `replication` with the desired value, and then include this parameter along with other parameters for the cloud provider, as follows:

```yaml
{
 "universe_name": "cloud-override-demo",
 "replication": 5,
 "num_nodes": 5 # if the replication factor is 5, num_nodes must be 5 minimum
}
```

*replication* must be set to 1, 3, 5, or 7.

#### Override the volume settings

To override the volume settings, include `num_volumes` with the desired value, as well as `volume_size` with the volume size in GB for each of those volumes. For example, to have two volumes with 100GB each, overrides should be specified as follows:

```yaml
{
 "universe_name": "cloud-override-demo",
 "num_volumes": 2,
 "volume_size": 100
}
```

#### Override the YugabyteDB software version

To override the YugabyteDB software version to be used, include `yb_version` with the desired value, ensuring that this version exists in YBA, as follows:

```yaml
{
 "universe_name": "cloud-override-demo",
 "yb_version": "1.1.6.0-b4"
}
```
