After creating the on-premises provider, you can add instances to its free pool of nodes.

1. Navigate to **Integrations > Infrastructure > On-Premises Datacenters**, and select the on-premises configuration you created.
1. Select **Instances**.

This displays the configured instance types and instances for the selected provider.

<ul class="nav nav-tabs-alt nav-tabs-yb custom-tabs">
  <li>
    <a href="#automatic" class="nav-link active" id="automatic-tab" data-bs-toggle="tab"
      role="tab" aria-controls="automatic" aria-selected="true">
      Automatic Provisioning
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#manual" class="nav-link" id="manual-tab" data-bs-toggle="tab"
      role="tab" aria-controls="manual" aria-selected="false">
      Manual Provisioning
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>
<div class="tab-content">
  <div id="automatic" class="tab-pane fade show active" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="automatic-tab">

For automatic provisioning, the **Instances** page is displayed as follows:

![Configure on-prem instances](/images/yb-platform/config/yba-onprem-config-instances.png)

  </div>

  <div id="manual" class="tab-pane fade" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="manual-tab">

For manual provisioning, the **Instances** page includes the command for running the provisioning script, as follows:

  </div>

</div>

To add nodes, do the following:

1. Specify the compute [instance types](#add-instance-types) that will be used in this provider.
1. [Add the compute instances](#add-instances).
1. [Run preflight checks](#run-preflight-checks).

## Add instance types

An instance type defines some basic properties of a VM.

To add an instance type, do the following:

1. On the configuration **Instances** page, click **Add Instance Type**.

1. Complete the **Add Instance Type** dialog fields, as follows:

    - Use the **Name** field to define a value to be used internally as an identifier in the **Instance Type** universe field.
    - Use the **Number of Cores** field to define the number of cores to be assigned to a node.
    - Use the **Memory Size (GB)** field to define the memory allocation of a node.
    - Use the **Volume Size (GB)** field to define the disk volume of a node.
    - Use the **Mount Paths** field to define a mount point with enough space to contain your node density. Use `/data`. If you have multiple drives, add these as a comma-separated list, such as, for example, `/mnt/d0,/mnt/d1`.

1. Click **Add Instance Type**.

## Add instances

Before you add instances, you need the following:

- The IP addresses of your VMs. See [Software requirements for nodes](../../prepare/server-nodes-software/).
- Instance type to assign each instance. The instance types define properties of the instances, along with the mount points. See [Add instance types](#add-instance-types).
- If you are doing [assisted manual provisioning](../on-premises/#stage-3-add-nodes-to-the-provider-free-pool), you must provision the nodes using the script. Follow the instructions in [Assisted manual provisioning](../on-premises-script/).

### Add instances to the on-premises provider

To add the instances, do the following:

1. On the configuration **Instances** page, click **Add Instances**.

    ![On-prem Add Instance Types dialog](/images/yb-platform/config/yba-onprem-config-add-instances.png)

1. For each node in each region, provide the following:

    - Select the zone.
    - Select the instance type.
    - Enter the IP address of the instance. You can use DNS names or IP addresses when adding instances.
    - Optionally, enter an Instance ID; this is a user-defined identifier.

    Note that if you provide a hostname, the universe might experience issues communicating. To resolve this, you need to delete the failed universe and then recreate it with the `use_node_hostname_for_local_tserver` flag enabled.

1. Click **+ Add** to add additional nodes in a region.

1. Click **Add** when you are done.

    The instances are added to the **Instances** list.

## Run preflight checks

After the instances are available in the **Instances** list, validate them by performing a preflight check.

- For each instance, click **Actions**, choose **Perform check**, and click **Apply**.

YugabyteDB Anywhere runs the check and displays the status in the **Preflight Check** column. Click in the column to view details; you can also view the results under **Tasks**.

If all your instances successfully pass the preflight check, your on-premises cloud provider configuration is ready, and you can begin [deploying universes](../../create-deployments/).
