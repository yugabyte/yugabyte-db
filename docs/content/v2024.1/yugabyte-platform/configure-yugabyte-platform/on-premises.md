Before you can deploy universes to private clouds using YugabyteDB Anywhere (YBA), you must create a provider configuration.

With on-premises providers, VMs are _not_ auto-created by YBA; you must manually create your VMs, provision them with YugabyteDB software, and then add them to the provider's free pool of nodes.

## Overview

To create, provision, and add nodes to your on-premises provider, you will perform tasks in roughly three stages.

### Stage 1: Prepare your infrastructure

- Have your network administrator set up firewalls to open the ports required for YBA and the nodes to communicate. Refer to [Networking](../../prepare/networking/).
- Have your system administrator create VMs that will be used as nodes in universes. This is typically done using your hypervisor or cloud provider. Do the following:
  - Locate the VMs in the regions and availability zones where you will be deploying universes.
  - Install a YugabyteDB-supported Linux OS on the VMs.
  - Set up a `yugabyte` user with root privileges (SSH access and sudo-capable).

  For instructions on creating VMs that are suitable for deploying YugabyteDB, refer to [Software requirements for on-premises nodes](../../prepare/server-nodes-software/software-on-prem/).

### Stage 2: Create an on-premises provider configuration

In YBA, create an on-premises provider. This involves the following:

- Defining the regions and availability zones where the provider will be deploying universes.
- Providing SSH credentials for the `yugabyte` user.
- Providing NTP setup.
- If the SSH user does not have passwordless sudo access, enabling Manual provisioning for the provider.

Refer to [Create the provider configuration](../on-premises-provider/).

### Stage 3: Add nodes to the provider free pool

In YBA, navigate to the provider you created in Stage 2 and do the following:

1. Define instance types. An instance type defines some basic properties of the VMs you will be adding.
1. Provision the VMs. YBA supports 3 ways of provisioning nodes for running YugabyteDB depending upon the level of SSH access provided to YBA:

    | Provisioning | Description | What happens |
    | :--- | :--- | :--- |
    | Automatic | YBA is provided an SSH user with sudo access for the nodes it needs to provision. For example, the `ec2-user` for AWS EC2 instances. | No action. YBA will automatically provision the VMs that you add. |
    | Assisted&nbsp;manual | The SSH user requires a password for sudo access. | Run a script, provided by YBA, to provision each VM, providing credentials for the SSH user with sudo access. |
    | Fully manual | Neither YBA nor the user has access to an SSH user with sudo access; only a local (non-SSH) user is available with sudo access. | Follow a sequence of steps to [provision each VM manually](../../prepare/server-nodes-software/software-on-prem-manual/) before adding the VM to the pool. |

1. Add the VMs (instances) to the provider.

1. Run pre-checks to validate the nodes you added.

Refer to [Add nodes to the on-premises provider](../on-premises-nodes/).
