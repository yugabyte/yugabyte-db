YugabyteDB Anywhere allows you to protect data in transit by using the following:

- Node-to-Node TLS to encrypt intra-node communication between YB-Master and YB-TServer nodes.
- Client-to-Node TLS to encrypt communication between a universe and clients. This includes applications, shells (ysqlsh, ycqlsh, psql, and so on), and other tools, using the YSQL and YCQL APIs.

## Manage certificates

YugabyteDB Anywhere uses TLS certificates to encrypt and validate connections. These certificates can be automatically generated and managed by YugabyteDB Anywhere, or you can add your own custom certificates.

Navigate to **Integrations > Security > Encryption in Transit** to view and add the certificates used for encryption in transit.

To view certificate details, click **Show details** for the certificate you want to view.

## Enable encryption in transit

You enable Node-to-Node and Client-to-Node encryption in transit when you [create a universe](../../create-deployments/create-universe-multi-zone/).

You can also enable and disable encryption in transit for an existing universe as follows:

1. Navigate to your universe.
1. Click **Actions > Edit Security > Encryption in-Transit** to open the **Manage encryption in transit** dialog.
1. Enable or disable the **Enable encryption in transit for this Universe** option.
1. Click **Apply**.

### Enforce TLS versions

As TLS 1.0 and 1.1 are no longer accepted by PCI compliance, and considering significant vulnerabilities around these versions of the protocol, it is recommended that you migrate to TLS 1.2 or later versions.

You can set the TLS version for node-to-node and client-node communication. To enforce TLS 1.2, add the following flag for YB-TServer:

```shell
ssl_protocols = tls12
```

To enforce the minimum TLS version of 1.2, you need to specify all available subsequent versions for YB-TServer, as follows:

```shell
ssl_protocols = tls12,tls13
```

In addition, as the `ssl_protocols` setting does not propagate to PostgreSQL, it is recommended that you specify the minimum TLS version (`ssl_min_protocol_version`) for PostgreSQL by setting the following YB-TServer flag:

```shell
--ysql_pg_conf_csv="ssl_min_protocol_version='TLSv1.2'"
```
