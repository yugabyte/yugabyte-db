Due to the strong [ACID](../../../../architecture/transactions/transactions-overview/) properties guaranteed by YugabyteDB, failures during transactions are inevitable. You need to design your applications to take appropriate action on failed statements to ensure they are highly available. YugabyteDB returns various error codes for errors that occur during transaction processing.

The following error codes typically occur during transaction processing.

## 25001: Active SQL transaction

This error occurs when certain statements that should be run outside a transaction block, typically because they have non-rollback-able side effects or do internal commits, are executed inside a transaction block. For example, issuing a `BEGIN` statement inside a transaction.

```output
WARNING:  25001: there is already a transaction in progress
```

{{<note>}}
**25001** errors are just warnings. But the code needs to be fixed to avoid future warnings.
{{</note>}}

## 25006: Read only SQL transaction

This error occurs when certain statements are executed in a read-only transaction that violate the read-only constraint. For example, modifying records inside a read-only transaction.

```output
ERROR:  25006: cannot execute UPDATE in a read-only transaction
```

{{<note>}}
**25006** errors are [Non-retriable](../transactions-retries-ysql/#non-retriable-errors). Writes should be removed from the read-only transaction code.
{{</note>}}

## 25P01: No active SQL transaction

This error occurs when certain statements that should be executed in a transaction are executed outside of a transaction. For example, issuing a `ROLLBACK` outside a transaction.

```output
WARNING:  25P01: there is no transaction in progress
```

{{<note>}}
**25P01** errors are just warnings. But the code needs to be fixed to avoid future warnings.
{{</note>}}

## 25P02: In failed SQL transaction

This error occurs when statements have failed inside a transaction and another statement other than `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` is executed.

```output
ERROR:  25P02: current transaction is aborted, commands ignored until end of transaction block
```

{{<note>}}
**25P02** errors are [Non-retriable](../transactions-retries-ysql/#non-retriable-errors). Proper error handling via a `try..catch` block and either `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` should be executed appropriately.
{{</note>}}

## 25P03: Idle in transaction session timeout

This occurs when an application stays idle longer than `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` in the middle of a transaction.

```output
FATAL:  25P03: terminating connection due to idle-in-transaction timeout
```

{{<note>}}
The client can reconnect to the server and retry the transaction.
{{</note>}}

## 40001: Serialization failure

This error occurs when a transaction cannot be applied or progress further because of other conflicting transactions. For example, when multiple transactions are modifying the same key.

```output
ERROR:  could not serialize access due to concurrent update (...)
```

{{<lead link="../transactions-retries-ysql/#client-side-retry">}}
Serialization failure errors can be retried by the client. See [Client-side retry](../transactions-retries-ysql/#client-side-retry).
{{</lead>}}

## 40P01: Deadlock detected

This error occurs when two or more transactions wait on each other to form a deadlock cycle. One or more of the transactions in the cycle are aborted and they fail with the following error.

```output
ERROR:  deadlock detected (...)
```

{{<lead link="../transactions-retries-ysql/#client-side-retry">}}
Deadlock detected errors can be retried by the client. See [Client-side retry](../transactions-retries-ysql/#client-side-retry).
{{</lead>}}

## 2D000: Invalid transaction termination

This error occurs when a transaction is terminated either by a `COMMIT` or a `ROLLBACK` in an invalid location. For example, when a `COMMIT` is issued inside a stored procedure that is called from inside a transaction.

```output
ERROR:  2D000: invalid transaction termination
```

{{<note>}}
**2D000** errors are [Non-retriable](../transactions-retries-ysql/#non-retriable-errors). The transaction code needs to be fixed to get around this error.
{{</note>}}

## 3B001: Invalid savepoint specification

This error occurs when you try to `ROLLBACK` to or `RELEASE` a savepoint that has not been defined.

```output
ERROR:  3B001: savepoint "FIRST_SAVE" does not exist
```

{{<note>}}
**3B001** errors are [Non-retriable](../transactions-retries-ysql/#non-retriable-errors). The transaction code needs to be fixed to specify the correct savepoint name to fix this error.
