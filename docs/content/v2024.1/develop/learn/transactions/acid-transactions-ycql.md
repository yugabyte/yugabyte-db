{{<api-tabs>}}

A transaction is a sequence of operations performed as a single logical unit of work. YugabyteDB provides [ACID](../../../../architecture/key-concepts#acid) guarantees for all transactions:

{{<note title="Note">}}
Although YugabyteDB supports only *Snapshot* isolation level in the YCQL API, it supports three levels of isolation in the [YSQL](../../../../explore/transactions/isolation-levels/) API: *Snapshot*, *Serializable*, and *Read Committed*.
{{</note>}}

## Transactions property

To enable distributed transactions on tables in YCQL, create tables with the `transactions` property enabled, as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS <TABLE_NAME> (...) WITH transactions = { 'enabled' : true };
```

## Example with ycqlsh

### Create keyspace and table

Create a keyspace:

```sql
ycqlsh> CREATE KEYSPACE banking;
```

Create a table with the `transactions` property set enabled as follows:

```sql
ycqlsh> CREATE TABLE banking.accounts (
  account_name varchar,
  account_type varchar,
  balance float,
  PRIMARY KEY ((account_name), account_type)
) with transactions = { 'enabled' : true };
```

You can verify that this table has transactions enabled on it by running the following query:

```sql
ycqlsh> select keyspace_name, table_name, transactions from system_schema.tables
where keyspace_name='banking' AND table_name = 'accounts';
```

```output
 keyspace_name | table_name | transactions
---------------+------------+---------------------
       banking |   accounts | {'enabled': 'true'}

(1 rows)
```

### Insert sample data

Seed the table with some sample data as follows:

```sql
INSERT INTO banking.accounts (account_name, account_type, balance) VALUES ('John', 'savings', 1000);
INSERT INTO banking.accounts (account_name, account_type, balance) VALUES ('John', 'checking', 100);
INSERT INTO banking.accounts (account_name, account_type, balance) VALUES ('Smith', 'savings', 2000);
INSERT INTO banking.accounts (account_name, account_type, balance) VALUES ('Smith', 'checking', 50);
```

Show the balances for John and Smith:

```sql
ycqlsh> select * from banking.accounts;
```

```output
 account_name | account_type | balance
--------------+--------------+---------
         John |     checking |     100
         John |      savings |    1000
        Smith |     checking |      50
        Smith |      savings |    2000
```

Check John's balance as follows:

```sql
ycqlsh> SELECT SUM(balance) as Johns_balance FROM banking.accounts WHERE account_name='John';
```

```output
 johns_balance
---------------
          1100
```

Check Smith's balance as follows:

```sql
ycqlsh> SELECT SUM(balance) as smiths_balance FROM banking.accounts WHERE account_name='Smith';
```

```output
 smiths_balance
----------------
           2050

```

### Execute a transaction

Suppose John transfers $200 from his savings account to his checking account. This has to be a transactional operation. This can be achieved as follows:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION
  UPDATE banking.accounts SET balance = balance - 200 WHERE account_name='John' AND account_type='savings';
  UPDATE banking.accounts SET balance = balance + 200 WHERE account_name='John' AND account_type='checking';
END TRANSACTION;
```

If you now selected the value of John's account, you should see the amounts reflected. The total balance should be the same $1100 as before.

```sql
ycqlsh> select * from banking.accounts where account_name='John';
```

```output
 account_name | account_type | balance
--------------+--------------+---------
         John |     checking |     300
         John |      savings |     800
```

Check John's balance as follows:

```sql
ycqlsh> SELECT SUM(balance) as Johns_balance FROM banking.accounts WHERE account_name='John';
```

```output
 johns_balance
---------------
          1100
```

Further, the checking and savings account balances for John should have been written at the same write timestamp.

```sql
ycqlsh> select account_name, account_type, balance, writetime(balance)
from banking.accounts where account_name='John';
```

```output
 account_name | account_type | balance | writetime(balance)
--------------+--------------+---------+--------------------
         John |     checking |     300 |   1517898028890171
         John |      savings |     800 |   1517898028890171
```

Now suppose John transfers the $200 from his checking account to Smith's checking account. You can accomplish this with the following transaction:

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION
  UPDATE banking.accounts SET balance = balance - 200 WHERE account_name='John' AND account_type='checking';
  UPDATE banking.accounts SET balance = balance + 200 WHERE account_name='Smith' AND account_type='checking';
END TRANSACTION;
```

To verify the transfer was made as intended, and also verify that the time at which the two accounts were updated are identical, perform the following query:

```sql
ycqlsh> select account_name, account_type, balance, writetime(balance) from banking.accounts;
```

```output
 account_name | account_type | balance | writetime(balance)
--------------+--------------+---------+--------------------
         John |     checking |     100 |   1517898167629366
         John |      savings |     800 |   1517898028890171
        Smith |     checking |     250 |   1517898167629366
        Smith |      savings |    2000 |   1517894361290020
```

The net balance for John should have decreased by $200, and that of Smith should have increased by $200.

Check John's balance as follows:

```sql
ycqlsh> SELECT SUM(balance) as Johns_balance FROM banking.accounts WHERE account_name='John';
```

```output
 johns_balance
---------------
           900
```

Check Smith's balance as follows:

```sql
ycqlsh> SELECT SUM(balance) as smiths_balance FROM banking.accounts WHERE account_name='Smith';
```

```output
 smiths_balance
----------------
           2250
```

## Example in Java

##### Create the table

The following example shows how to create a basic key-value table which has two columns with transactions enabled:

```java
String create_stmt =
  String.format("CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS %s (k varchar, v varchar, primary key (k)) " +
                "WITH transactions = { 'enabled' : true };",
                tablename);
```

### Insert or update data

You can insert data by performing the sequence of commands inside a `BEGIN TRANSACTION` and `END TRANSACTION` block.

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION
  statement 1
  statement 2
END TRANSACTION;
```

The following code snippet shows how you would insert data into this table:

```java
// Insert two key values, (key1, value1) and (key2, value2) as a transaction.
String create_stmt =
  String.format("BEGIN TRANSACTION" +
                "  INSERT INTO %s (k, v) VALUES (%s, %s);" +
                "  INSERT INTO %s (k, v) VALUES (%s, %s);" +
                "END TRANSACTION;",
                tablename, key1, value1,
                tablename, key2, value2);
```

### Prepare-bind transactions

You can prepare statements with transactions and bind variables to the prepared statements when executing the query.

```java
String create_stmt =
  String.format("BEGIN TRANSACTION" +
                "  INSERT INTO %s (k, v) VALUES (:k1, :v1);" +
                "  INSERT INTO %s (k, v) VALUES (:k2, :v2);" +
                "END TRANSACTION;",
                tablename, key1, value1,
                tablename, key2, value2);
PreparedStatement pstmt = client.prepare(create_stmt);

...

BoundStatement txn1 = pstmt.bind().setString("k1", key1)
                                  .setString("v1", value1)
                                  .setString("k2", key2)
                                  .setString("v2", value2);

ResultSet resultSet = client.execute(txn1);
```

## Note on linearizability

Automatic retries can break linearizability of operations from the client point of view.

By default, the original Cassandra Java driver and the YugabyteDB Cassandra Java driver use `com.datastax.driver.core.policies.DefaultRetryPolicy`, which can retry requests upon timeout on the client side. Under network partitions, this can lead to the case where the client gets a successful response to a retried request and treats the operation as completed, but the value might get overwritten by an older operation due to retries.

To avoid these linearizability issues, add `com.yugabyte.driver.core.policies.NoRetryOnClientTimeoutPolicy`, which inherits behavior from `DefaultRetryPolicy` with one exception - it results in an error in cases where the operation times out (with `OperationTimedOutException`). You can then handle client timeouts in the application layer.
