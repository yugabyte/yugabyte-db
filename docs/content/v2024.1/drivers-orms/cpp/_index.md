## Supported projects

The following projects are recommended for implementing Rust applications using the YugabyteDB YSQL/YCQL API.

| Project | Example apps |
| :------ | :----------- |
| libpqxx C++ Driver | [Hello World](ysql/) |
| YugabyteDB C++ driver for YCQL | [Hello World](ycql/) |

For fully-runnable code snippets and explanations of common operations, see the **example apps**. Before running the example apps, make sure you have installed the prerequisites.

## Prerequisites

To develop C applications for YugabyteDB, you need the following:

- **Machine and Software requirements**
  - a 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) architecture machine.
  - gcc 4.1.2 or later, clang 3.4 or later installed.

- **YugabyteDB cluster**
  - Create a free cluster on YugabyteDB Aeon. Refer to [Use a cloud cluster](/preview/tutorials/quick-start-yugabytedb-managed/). Note that YugabyteDB Aeon requires SSL.
  - Alternatively, set up a standalone YugabyteDB cluster by following the steps in [Install YugabyteDB](/preview/tutorials/quick-start/).
