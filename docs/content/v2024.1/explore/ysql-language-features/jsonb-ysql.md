JSON data types are for storing JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data, as specified in [RFC 7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159). Such data can also be stored as `text`, but the JSON data types have the advantage of enforcing that each stored value is valid according to the JSON rules. Assorted JSON-specific functions and operators are also available for data stored in these data types. JSON functionality in YSQL is nearly identical to the [JSON functionality in PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/datatype-json.html).

## JSON vs JSONB

YSQL supports two JSON data types, which accept *almost* identical sets of values as input. The major practical difference is one of efficiency.

| Type | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| JSON | Stores an exact copy of the input text, and therefore preserves semantically-insignificant white space between tokens, as well as the order of keys in JSON objects. Also, if a JSON object in the value contains the same key more than once, all the key/value pairs are kept.<br>The processing functions consider the last value as the operative one, and must re-parse the JSON on each execution. |
| JSONB | Does not preserve white space, does not preserve the order of object keys, and does not keep duplicate object keys. If duplicate keys are specified in the input, only the last value is kept.<br>Data is stored in a decomposed binary format that makes it slightly slower to input due to added conversion overhead, but significantly faster to process, because no re-parsing is needed. JSONB also supports indexing, which can be a significant advantage. |

In general, most applications should prefer to store JSON data as JSONB, unless there are quite specialized needs, such as legacy assumptions about ordering of object keys.

## Setup

The examples run on any YugabyteDB universe.

<!-- begin: nav tabs -->
{{<nav/tabs list="local,anywhere,cloud" active="local"/>}}

{{<nav/panels>}}
{{<nav/panel name="local" active="true">}}
<!-- local cluster setup instructions -->
{{<setup/local numnodes="1" rf="1" >}}

{{</nav/panel>}}

{{<nav/panel name="anywhere">}} {{<setup/anywhere>}} {{</nav/panel>}}
{{<nav/panel name="cloud">}}{{<setup/cloud>}}{{</nav/panel>}}
{{</nav/panels>}}
<!-- end: nav tabs -->

To illustrate, create a basic table `books` with a primary key and one JSONB column `doc` that contains various details about each book.

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# CREATE TABLE books(k int primary key, doc jsonb not null);
```

Next, insert some rows which contain details about various books. These details are represented as JSON documents.

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# INSERT INTO books(k, doc) values
  (1,
  '{ "ISBN"    : 4582546494267,
     "title"   : "Macbeth",
     "author"  : {"given_name": "William", "family_name": "Shakespeare"},
     "year"    : 1623}'),

  (2,
  '{ "ISBN"    : 8760835734528,
     "title"   : "Hamlet",
     "author"  : {"given_name": "William", "family_name": "Shakespeare"},
     "year"    : 1603,
     "editors" : ["Lysa", "Elizabeth"] }'),

  (3,
  '{ "ISBN"    : 7658956876542,
     "title"   : "Oliver Twist",
     "author"  : {"given_name": "Charles", "family_name": "Dickens"},
     "year"    : 1838,
     "genre"   : "novel",
     "editors" : ["Mark", "Tony", "Britney"] }'),
  (4,
  '{ "ISBN"    : 9874563896457,
     "title"   : "Great Expectations",
     "author"  : {"family_name": "Dickens"},
     "year"    : 1950,
     "genre"   : "novel",
     "editors" : ["Robert", "John", "Melisa", "Elizabeth"] }'),

  (5,
  '{ "ISBN"    : 8647295405123,
     "title"   : "A Brief History of Time",
     "author"  : {"given_name": "Stephen", "family_name": "Hawking"},
     "year"    : 1988,
     "genre"   : "science",
     "editors" : ["Melisa", "Mark", "John", "Fred", "Jane"] }'),

  (6,
  '{
    "ISBN"     : 6563973589123,
    "year"     : 1989,
    "genre"    : "novel",
    "title"    : "Joy Luck Club",
    "author"   : {"given_name": "Amy", "family_name": "Tan"},
    "editors"  : ["Ruilin", "Aiping"]}');
```

{{< note title="Note" >}}
Some of the rows in the example have some of the keys missing (intentional). But the row with "k=6" has every key.
{{< /note >}}

## Query JSON documents

List all the rows thus:

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# SELECT * FROM books;
```

This is the result:

```output
 k |                                                                                                         doc
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(6 rows)
```

### Using `->` and `->>`

YSQL has two native operators to query JSON documents:

- [`->`](../../../api/ysql/datatypes/type_json/functions-operators/subvalue-operators/#the-160-160-160-160-operator) returns a JSON object.
- [`->>`](../../../api/ysql/datatypes/type_json/functions-operators/subvalue-operators/#the-160-160-160-160-and-160-160-160-160-operators) returns text.

These operators work on both JSON and JSONB columns to select a subset of attributes as well as to inspect the JSON document.

The following example shows how to select a few attributes from each document.

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# SELECT doc->'title' AS book_title,
              CONCAT(doc->'author'->'family_name',
              ', ', doc->'author'->'given_name') AS author
            FROM books;
```

This is the result:

```output
        book_title         |          author
---------------------------+--------------------------
 "A Brief History of Time" | "Hawking", "Stephen"
 "Macbeth"                 | "Shakespeare", "William"
 "Joy Luck Club"           | "Tan", "Amy"
 "Great Expectations"      | "Dickens",
 "Hamlet"                  | "Shakespeare", "William"
 "Oliver Twist"            | "Dickens", "Charles"
(6 rows)
```

Because the `->` operator returns an object, you can chain it to inspect deep into a JSON document, as follows:

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# SELECT '{"title": "Macbeth", "author": {"given_name": "William"}}'::jsonb
              -> 'author' -> 'given_name' as first_name;
```

This is the result:

```output
 first_name
------------
 "William"
(1 row)
```

### Existence with `?`

The [`?` operator](../../../api/ysql/datatypes/type_json/functions-operators/key-or-value-existence-operators/#the-160-160-160-160-operator) can be used to check if a JSON document contains a certain attribute. For example, if you want to find a count of the records where the `doc` column contains a property named *genre*, run the following statement:

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# SELECT doc->'title' AS book_title,
              doc->'genre' AS genre
              FROM books WHERE doc ? 'genre';
```

This is the result:

```output
        book_title         |   genre
---------------------------+-----------
 "A Brief History of Time" | "science"
 "Joy Luck Club"           | "novel"
 "Great Expectations"      | "novel"
 "Oliver Twist"            | "novel"
(4 rows)
```

### Containment with `@>`

The [containment operator `@>`](../../../api/ysql/datatypes/type_json/functions-operators/containment-operators/) tests whether one document contains another. If you want to find all books that contain the JSON value `{"author": {"given_name": "William"}}` (in other words, the author of the book has the given name *William*), do the following:

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# SELECT doc->'title' AS book_title,
              CONCAT(doc->'author'->'family_name',
              ', ', doc->'author'->'given_name') AS author
            FROM books
            WHERE doc @> '{"author": {"given_name": "William"}}'::jsonb;
```

This is the result:

```output
 book_title |          author
------------+--------------------------
 "Macbeth"  | "Shakespeare", "William"
 "Hamlet"   | "Shakespeare", "William"
(2 rows)
```

## Update JSON documents

You can update a JSON document in a number of ways, as shown in the following examples.

### Add an attribute

Use the [`||` operator](../../../api/ysql/datatypes/type_json/functions-operators/concatenation-operator/) to either update or insert the attribute into the existing JSON document. For example, if you want to add a `stock` attribute to all the books, do the following:

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# UPDATE books SET doc = doc || '{"stock": "true"}';
```

This is the result:

```sql
yugabyte=# SELECT doc->'title' AS title, doc->'stock' AS stock FROM books;
```

```output
           title           | stock
---------------------------+--------
 "A Brief History of Time" | "true"
 "Macbeth"                 | "true"
 "Joy Luck Club"           | "true"
 "Great Expectations"      | "true"
 "Hamlet"                  | "true"
 "Oliver Twist"            | "true"
(6 rows)
```

### Remove an attribute

Use the [`-` operator](../../../api/ysql/datatypes/type_json/functions-operators/remove-operators/#the-160-160-160-160-operator) to remove an attribute:

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# UPDATE books SET doc = doc - 'stock';
```

This removes the field from all the documents, as shown below.

```sql
yugabyte=# SELECT doc->'title' AS title, doc->'stock' AS stock FROM books;
```

```output
           title           | stock
---------------------------+-------
 "A Brief History of Time" |
 "Macbeth"                 |
 "Joy Luck Club"           |
 "Great Expectations"      |
 "Hamlet"                  |
 "Oliver Twist"            |
(6 rows)
```

### Replace a document

To replace an entire document, run the following SQL statement:

```plpgsql
UPDATE books
    SET doc = '{"ISBN": 4582546494267, "year": 1623, "title": "Macbeth", "author": {"given_name": "William", "family_name": "Shakespeare"}}'
    WHERE k=1;
```

## Built-in functions

YSQL supports a large number of operators and built-in functions that operate on JSON documents. This section highlights a few of these built-in functions.

YSQL supports all of the built-in functions supported by PostgreSQL. For a complete list, refer to [JSON functions and operators](../../../api/ysql/datatypes/type_json/functions-operators/).

### Expand JSON - `jsonb_each`

The [`jsonb_each()`](../../../api/ysql/datatypes/type_json/functions-operators/jsonb-each/) function expands the top-level JSON document into a set of key-value pairs, as shown below.

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# SELECT jsonb_each(doc) FROM books WHERE k=1;
```

The output is shown below.

```output
                                 jsonb_each
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 (ISBN,4582546494267)
 (year,1623)
 (title,"""Macbeth""")
 (author,"{""given_name"": ""William"", ""family_name"": ""Shakespeare""}")
(4 rows)
```

### Retrieve keys - `jsonb_object_keys`

The [`jsonb_object_keys()`](../../../api/ysql/datatypes/type_json/functions-operators/jsonb-object-keys/) function retrieves the keys of the top-level JSON document thus:

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# SELECT jsonb_object_keys(doc) FROM books WHERE k=1;
```

This is the result:

```output
 jsonb_object_keys
-------------------
 ISBN
 year
 title
 author
(4 rows)
```

### Format JSON - `jsonb_pretty`

When you select a JSONB (or JSON) value in ysqlsh, you see the terse `text` typecast of the value. The [`jsonb_pretty()`](../../../api/ysql/datatypes/type_json/functions-operators/jsonb-pretty/) function returns a more human-readable format:

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# SELECT jsonb_pretty(doc) FROM books WHERE k=1;
```

This is the result:

```output
             jsonb_pretty
--------------------------------------
 {                                   +
     "ISBN": 4582546494267,          +
     "year": 1623,                   +
     "title": "Macbeth",             +
     "author": {                     +
         "given_name": "William",    +
         "family_name": "Shakespeare"+
     }                               +
 }
(1 row)
```

## Constraints

You can create constraints on JSONB data types. This section includes some examples. For a fuller discussion, refer to [Create indexes and check constraints on JSON columns](../../../api/ysql/datatypes/type_json/create-indexes-check-constraints/).

### Check JSON documents are objects

Here's how to insist that each JSON document is an object:

```plpgsql
alter table books
add constraint books_doc_is_object
check (jsonb_typeof(doc) = 'object');
```

### Check ISBN is a 13-digit number

Here's how to insist that the ISBN is always defined and is a positive 13-digit number:

```plpgsql
alter table books
add constraint books_isbn_is_positive_13_digit_number
check (
  (doc->'ISBN') is not null
    and
  jsonb_typeof(doc->'ISBN') = 'number'
     and
  (doc->>'ISBN')::bigint > 0
    and
  length(((doc->>'ISBN')::bigint)::text) = 13
);
```

## Indexes on JSON attributes

Indexes are essential to perform efficient lookups by document attributes. Without indexes, queries on document attributes end up performing a full table scan and process each JSON document. This section outlines some of the indexes supported.

### Secondary index

If you want to support range queries that reference the value for the *year* attribute, do the following:

```plpgsql
CREATE INDEX books_year
    ON books (((doc->>'year')::int) ASC)
    WHERE doc->>'year' is not null;
```

This will make the following query efficient:

```plpgsql
select
  (doc->>'ISBN')::bigint as isbn,
  doc->>'title'          as title,
  (doc->>'year')::int    as year
from books
where (doc->>'year')::int > 1850
and doc->>'year' IS NOT NULL
order by 3;
```

### Partial and expression indexes

You might want to index only those documents that contain the attribute (as opposed to indexing the rows that have a NULL value for that attribute). This is a common scenario because not all the documents would have all the attributes defined. This can be achieved using a *partial index*.

In the previous section where you created a secondary index, not all the books may have the `year` attribute defined. Suppose that you want to index only those documents that have a NOT NULL `year` attribute. Create the following partial index:

```plpgsql
CREATE INDEX books_year
    ON books ((doc->>'year') ASC)
    WHERE doc->>'year' IS NOT NULL;
```

### Unique index

You can create a unique index on the "ISBN" key for the books table as follows:

```plpgsql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX books_isbn_unq on books((doc->>'ISBN'));
```

Inserting a row with a duplicate value would fail as shown below. The book has a new primary key `k` but an existing ISBN, `4582546494267`.

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# INSERT INTO books values
           (7, '{  "ISBN"    : 4582546494267,
                   "title"   : "Fake Book with duplicate ISBN" }');
```

```output
ERROR:  23505: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "books_isbn_unq"
```
