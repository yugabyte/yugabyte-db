{{< note title="Note" >}}

- The number of nodes in a cluster running YB-TServers **must** equal or exceed the replication factor in order for any table to get created successfully.
- For running a single cluster across multiple data centers or 2 clusters in 2 data centers, refer to the [Multi-DC Deployments](../../../deploy/multi-dc/) section.

{{< /note >}}

This section covers deployment for a single region or data center in a multi-zone/multi-rack configuration. Note that single zone configuration is a special case of multi-zone where all placement related flags are set to the same value across every node.

## Example scenario

- Create a 6-node cluster with replication factor of 3.
  - YB-TServer server should on all the six nodes, and the YB-Master server should run on only three of these nodes.
  - Assume the three YB-Master private IP addresses are `172.151.17.130`, `172.151.17.220`, and `172.151.17.140`.
  - Cloud is AWS, region us-west, and the three availability zones us-west-2a, us-west-2b, and us-west-2c. Two nodes will be placed in each AZ in such a way that 1 replica for each tablet (aka shard) gets placed in any 1 node for each AZ.
- Multiple data drives mounted on `/home/centos/disk1`, `/home/centos/disk2`.

## Run YB-TServer with command line flags

Run the `yb-tserver` server on each of the six nodes as follows. Note that all of the master addresses have to be provided using the `--tserver_master_addrs` flag. Replace the [`--rpc_bind_addresses`](../../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#rpc-bind-addresses) value with the private IP address of the host, and set the `placement_cloud`, `placement_region`, and `placement_zone` values appropriately. For single zone deployment, use the same value for the `--placement_zone` flag.

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-tserver \
  --tserver_master_addrs 172.151.17.130:7100,172.151.17.220:7100,172.151.17.140:7100 \
  --rpc_bind_addresses 172.151.17.130:9100 \
  --enable_ysql \
  --pgsql_proxy_bind_address 172.151.17.130:5433 \
  --cql_proxy_bind_address 172.151.17.130:9042 \
  --fs_data_dirs "/home/centos/disk1,/home/centos/disk2" \
  --placement_cloud aws \
  --placement_region us-west \
  --placement_zone us-west-2a \
  >& /home/centos/disk1/yb-tserver.out &
```

For the full list of configuration flags, see the [YB-TServer reference](../../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/).

{{< note title="Note" >}}

The number of comma-separated values in the [`--tserver_master_addrs`](../../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#tserver-master-addrs)) flag should match the total number of YB-Master servers (or the replication factor).

## Run YB-TServer with configuration file

Alternatively, you can also create a `tserver.conf` file with the following flags and then run the `yb-tserver` with the [`--flagfile`](../../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#flagfile)) flag. For each YB-TServer server, replace the RPC bind address flags with the private IP address of the host running the YB-TServer server.

```sh
--tserver_master_addrs=172.151.17.130:7100,172.151.17.220:7100,172.151.17.140:7100
--rpc_bind_addresses=172.151.17.130:9100
--enable_ysql
--pgsql_proxy_bind_address=172.151.17.130:5433
--cql_proxy_bind_address=172.151.17.130:9042
--fs_data_dirs=/home/centos/disk1,/home/centos/disk2
--placement_cloud=aws
--placement_region=us-west
--placement_zone=us-west-2a
```

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-tserver --flagfile tserver.conf >& /home/centos/disk1/yb-tserver.out &
```

## Set replica placement policy

{{< note title="Note" >}}

This step is required for only multi-AZ deployments and can be skipped for a single AZ deployment.

{{< /note >}}

The default replica placement policy when the cluster is first created is to treat all nodes as equal irrespective of the `--placement_*` configuration flags.  However, for the current deployment, you want to explicitly place one replica of each tablet in each AZ. The following command sets replication factor of `3` across `us-west-2a`, `us-west-2b`, `us-west-2c` leading to such a placement.

On any host running the yb-master, run the following command.

```sh
$ ./bin/yb-admin \
    --master_addresses 172.151.17.130:7100,172.151.17.220:7100,172.151.17.140:7100 \
    modify_placement_info  \
    aws.us-west.us-west-2a,aws.us-west.us-west-2b,aws.us-west.us-west-2c 3
```

Verify by running the following.

```sh
$ curl -s http://<any-master-ip>:7000/cluster-config
```

Confirm that the output looks similar to the following, with `min_num_replicas` set to `1` for each AZ.

```output.json
replication_info {
  live_replicas {
    num_replicas: 3
    placement_blocks {
      cloud_info {
        placement_cloud: "aws"
        placement_region: "us-west"
        placement_zone: "us-west-2a"
      }
      min_num_replicas: 1
    }
    placement_blocks {
      cloud_info {
        placement_cloud: "aws"
        placement_region: "us-west"
        placement_zone: "us-west-2b"
      }
      min_num_replicas: 1
    }
    placement_blocks {
      cloud_info {
        placement_cloud: "aws"
        placement_region: "us-west"
        placement_zone: "us-west-2b"
      }
      min_num_replicas: 1
    }
  }
}
```

## Verify health

Make sure all YB-TServer servers are working as expected by inspecting the INFO log. The default logs directory is always inside the first directory specified in the [`--fs_data_dirs`](../../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#fs-data-dirs) flag.

You can do this as follows:

```sh
$ cat /home/centos/disk1/yb-data/tserver/logs/yb-tserver.INFO
```

In each of the four YB-TServer logs, you should see log messages similar to the following:

```output

```

In the current YB-Master leader log, you should see log messages similar to the following:

```output

```

{{< tip title="Tip" >}}

Remember to add the command you used to start the YB-TServer to a `cron` job to restart it if it goes down.

{{< /tip >}}

## Grow the cluster

To grow the cluster, add additional YB-TServer nodes just as you do when creating the cluster.
