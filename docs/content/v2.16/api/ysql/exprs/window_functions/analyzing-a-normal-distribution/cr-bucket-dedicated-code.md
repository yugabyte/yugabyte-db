-- This approach implements the required "open-closed" interval
-- bucket semantics directly. See the test
--
--   where scaled_val > lb and scaled_val <= ub
--
-- at the end.
--
-- You might consider this to be the better approach,  even though
-- it means saying "No thank you" to the free gift of the built-in
-- "width_bucket()" which -- acutally implements the wrong semantics
-- for the present use case. Fixing it up with a trick might feel to be
-- too offensive.
--
-- This implementation of "bucket()" also passes the rigorous
-- acceptance test.
