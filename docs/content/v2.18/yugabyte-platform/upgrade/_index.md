Keep YugabyteDB Anywhere (YBA) up to date for the latest fixes and improvements, and to be able to [upgrade your universes](../manage-deployments/upgrade-software/) to the latest version of YugabyteDB. You cannot upgrade a universe to a version of YugabyteDB that is later than the version of YugabyteDB Anywhere.

For information on which versions of YugabyteDB are compatible with your version of YBA, see [YugabyteDB Anywhere releases](/preview/releases/yba-releases/).

You can upgrade YBA using the following methods:

| Method | Using | Use If |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [YBA&nbsp;Installer](./upgrade-yp-installer/) | yba-ctl CLI | Your installation already uses YBA Installer. |
| [Replicated](./upgrade-yp-replicated/) | Replicated Admin Console | Your installation already uses Replicated.<br>Before you can migrate from a Replicated installation, upgrade to v2.20.1.3 or later using Replicated. |
| [Kubernetes](./upgrade-yp-kubernetes/) | Helm chart | You're deploying in Kubernetes. |

If you are upgrading a YBA installation with high availability enabled, follow the instructions provided in [Upgrade instances](../administer-yugabyte-platform/high-availability/#upgrade-instances).

If you have upgraded YBA to version 2.12 or later and [xCluster replication](../../explore/multi-region-deployments/asynchronous-replication-ysql/) for your universe was set up via yb-admin instead of the UI, follow the instructions provided in [Synchronize replication after upgrade](upgrade-yp-xcluster-ybadmin/).
