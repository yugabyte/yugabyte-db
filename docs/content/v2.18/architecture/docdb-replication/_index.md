This section describes how replication works in DocDB. The data in a DocDB table is split into tablets. By default, each tablet is synchronously replicated using the Raft algorithm across various nodes or fault domains (such as availability zones/racks/regions/cloud providers).

YugabyteDB also provides other advanced replication features. These include two forms of asynchronous replication of data:

* **xCluster** Data is asynchronously replicated between different YugabyteDB universes - both unidirectional replication (leader-follower) or  bidirectional replication across two universes.
* **Read replicas** The in-universe asynchronous replicas are called read replicas.

The YugabyteDB synchronous replication architecture is inspired by <a href="https://research.google.com/archive/spanner-osdi2012.pdf">Google Spanner</a>.

The YugabyteDB xCluster replication architecture is inspired by RDBMS databases such as Oracle, MySQL, and PostgreSQL.
