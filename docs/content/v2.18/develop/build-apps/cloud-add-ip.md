The tutorials assume you have deployed a YugabyteDB cluster in YugabyteDB Aeon or locally. Refer to [Quick start](/preview/tutorials/quick-start-yugabytedb-managed/).

In addition, if you are using YugabyteDB Aeon, you need the following to run the sample applications:

- The cluster CA certificate.
- Your computer added to the cluster IP allow list.
- If your cluster is deployed in a VPC, you need Public Access enabled if you want to connect your application from a public IP address (this doesn't apply if you are using a Sandbox cluster).

{{< note title="Note" >}}

To use smart driver load balancing features when connecting to clusters in YugabyteDB Aeon, applications using smart drivers must be deployed in a VPC that has been peered with the cluster VPC. For information on VPC networking in YugabyteDB Aeon, refer to [VPC network](../../../yugabyte-cloud/cloud-basics/cloud-vpcs/).

For applications that access the cluster from a non-peered network, use the upstream PostgreSQL driver instead; in this case, the cluster performs the load balancing. Applications that use smart drivers from non-peered networks fall back to the upstream driver behaviour automatically.

For more information on connecting applications in YugabyteDB Aeon, refer to [Connect applications](../../../yugabyte-cloud/cloud-connect/connect-applications/).

## Download your cluster certificate

YugabyteDB Aeon uses TLS 1.2 for communicating with clusters, and digital certificates to verify the identity of clusters. The [cluster CA certificate](../../../yugabyte-cloud/cloud-secure-clusters/cloud-authentication/) is used to verify the identity of the cluster when you connect to it from an application or client.

To download the certificate to the computer that will be connecting to the cluster, do the following:

![Download certificate and add IP](/images/yb-cloud/cloud-add-ip.gif)

1. In YugabyteDB Aeon, select your cluster and click **Connect**.
1. Click **YugabyteDB Client Shell** or **Connect to your Application**.
1. Click **Download CA Cert** to download the cluster `root.crt` certificate to your computer.

## Add your computer to the cluster IP allow list

Access to YugabyteDB Aeon clusters is limited to IP addresses that you explicitly allow using [IP allow lists](../../../yugabyte-cloud/cloud-secure-clusters/add-connections/). To enable applications to connect to your cluster, you need to add your computer's IP address to the cluster IP allow list.

To add your computer to the cluster IP allow list:

1. In YugabyteDB Aeon, select your cluster.
1. Click **Add IP Allow List**.
1. Click **Create New List and Add to Cluster**.
1. Enter a name for the allow list.
1. Click **Detect and add my IP to this list** to add your own IP address.
1. Click **Save**.

The allow list takes up to 30 seconds to become active.

## Enable Public Access

Clusters deployed in VPCs don't expose public IP addresses unless you explicitly turn on [Public Access](../../../yugabyte-cloud/cloud-secure-clusters/add-connections/#enabling-public-access). If your cluster is in a VPC and you are connecting from a public IP address (such as your computer), enable Public Access on the cluster **Settings** tab.
