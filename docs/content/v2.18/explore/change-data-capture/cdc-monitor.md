## Status of the deployed connector

You can use the rest APIs to monitor your deployed connectors. The following operations are available:

* List all connectors

   ```sh
   curl -X GET localhost:8083/connectors/
   ```

* Get a connector's configuration

   ```sh
   curl -X GET localhost:8083/connectors/<connector-name>
   ```

* Get the status of all tasks with their configuration

   ```sh
   curl -X GET localhost:8083/connectors/<connector-name>/tasks
   ```

* Get the status of the specified task

   ```sh
   curl -X GET localhost:8083/connectors/<connector-name>/tasks/<task-id>
   ```

* Get the connector's status, and the status of its tasks

   ```sh
   curl -X GET localhost:8083/connectors/<connector-name>/status
   ```

## Metrics

In addition to the built-in support for JMX metrics that Zookeeper, Kafka, and Kafka Connect provide, the YugabyteDB source connector provides the following types of metrics.

### CDC Service metrics

Provide information about CDC service in YugabyteDB.

| Metric name | Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| cdcsdk_change_event_count | `long` | The Change Event Count metric shows the number of records sent by the CDC Service. |
| cdcsdk_traffic_sent | `long` | Total traffic sent, in bytes. |
| cdcsdk_sent_lag_micros | `long` | The LAG metric is calculated by subtracting the timestamp of the latest record in the WAL of a tablet from the last record sent to the CDC connector. |
| cdcsdk_expiry_time_ms | `long` | The time left to read records from WAL is tracked by the Stream Expiry Time (ms). |

### Snapshot metrics

The **MBean** is `debezium.yugabytedb:type=connector-metrics,server=<database.server.name>,task=<task.id>,context=snapshot`.

Snapshot metrics are only available when a snapshot operation is active, or if a snapshot has occurred since the last connector start. The following snapshot metrics are available:

| Metric name | Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| LastEvent | `string` | The last snapshot event that the connector has read. |
| MilliSecondsSinceLastEvent | `long` | The number of milliseconds since the connector has read and processed the most recent event. |
| TotalNumberOfEventsSeen | `long` | The total number of events that this connector has seen since the last start or metrics reset. |
| NumberOfEventsFiltered | `long` | The number of events that have been filtered by include/exclude list filtering rules configured on the connector. |
| QueueTotalCapacity | `int` | The length the queue used to pass events between the snapshotter and the main Kafka Connect loop. |
| QueueRemainingCapacity | `int` | The free capacity of the queue used to pass events between the snapshotter and the main Kafka Connect loop. |
| SnapshotRunning | `boolean` | Whether the snapshot is currently running. |
| SnapshotPaused | `boolean` | Whether the snapshot was paused one or more times. |
| SnapshotAborted | `boolean` | Whether the snapshot has been aborted. |
| SnapshotCompleted | `boolean` | Whether the snapshot has been completed. |
| SnapshotDurationInSeconds | `long` | The total number of seconds that the snapshot has taken so far, even if not complete. Includes also time when snapshot was paused.|
| SnapshotPausedDurationInSeconds | `long` | The total number of seconds that the snapshot was paused. If the snapshot was paused more than once, this is the cumulative pause time. |
| MaxQueueSizeInBytes | `long` | The maximum buffer of the queue, in bytes. This metric is available if `max.queue.size.in.bytes` is set to a positive long value. |
| CurrentQueueSizeInBytes | `long` | The current volume, in bytes, of records in the queue. |

### Streaming metrics

The **MBean** is `debezium.yugabytedb:type=connector-metrics,server=<database.server.name>,task=<task.id>,context=streaming`.

The following streaming metrics are available:

| Metric name | Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| LastEvent | `string` | The last streaming event that the connector has read. |
| MilliSecondsSinceLastEvent | `long` | The number of milliseconds since the connector has read and processed the most recent event. |
| TotalNumberOfEventsSeen | `long` | The total number of events that this connector has seen since the last start or metrics reset. |
| TotalNumberOfCreateEventsSeen | `long` | The total number of create events that this connector has seen since the last start or metrics reset. |
| TotalNumberOfUpdateEventsSeen | `long` |The total number of update events that this connector has seen since the last start or metrics reset. |
| TotalNumberOfDeleteEventsSeen | `long` | The total number of delete events that this connector has seen since the last start or metrics reset. |
| NumberOfEventsFiltered | `long` | The total number of events (since the last start or metrics reset) that have been filtered by include/exclude list filtering rules configured on the connector. |
| QueueTotalCapacity | `int` | The length the queue used to pass events between the streamer and the main Kafka Connect loop. |
| QueueRemainingCapacity | `int` | The free capacity of the queue used to pass events between the streamer and the main Kafka Connect loop. |
| Connected | `boolean` | Indicates whether the connector is currently connected to the database server. |
| MilliSecondsBehindSource | `long` | The number of milliseconds between the last change eventâ€™s timestamp and when the connector processed it. The value incorporates any differences between the clocks on the machines where the database server and the connector are running. |
| SourceEventPosition | `Map<String, String>` | The coordinates of the last received event. |
| LastTransactionId | `string` | Transaction identifier of the last processed transaction. |
| MaxQueueSizeInBytes | `long` | The maximum buffer of the queue in bytes. This metric is available if `max.queue.size.in.bytes` is set to a positive long value. |
| CurrentQueueSizeInBytes | `long` | The current volume, in bytes, of records in the queue. |
