The Chinook sample database for a digital media store can be used to explore and learn YugabyteDB.

## About the Chinook database

The Chinook data model represents a digital media store, including tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices and customers.

- Media-related data was created using real data from an Apple iTunes library.
- Customer and employee information was created using fictitious names and addresses that can be located on Google maps, and other well formatted data (phone, fax, email, etc.)
- Sales information was auto generated using random data for a four year period.
  
The Chinook sample database includes:

- 11 tables
- A variety of indexes, primary and foreign key constraints
- Over 15,000 rows of data

For details, here's the entity relationship diagram of the Chinook data model.

## Before you begin

To install and use the Chinook sample database, you need to have installed and configured YugabyteDB. To get up and running quickly, see [Quick Start](/latest/quick-start/).

Install the Chinook sample database

### 1. Download the SQL scripts

You can download the Chinook database that is compatible with YugabyteDB from the [`sample` directory of the YugabyteDB GitHub repository](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/tree/master/sample). Download the following three files.

- [`chinook_ddl.sql`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/42799a519726c75f502f463795ac6cd3ebda40c2/sample/chinook_ddl.sql) — Creates the tables and constraints
- [`chinook_genres_artists_albums.sql`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/42799a519726c75f502f463795ac6cd3ebda40c2/sample/chinook_genres_artists_albums.sql) — Loads artist and album information
- [`chinook_songs.sql`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/42799a519726c75f502f463795ac6cd3ebda40c2/sample/chinook_songs.sql) — Loads individual song information

### 2. Open the YSQL shell

To open the YSQL shell, run the `ysqlsh` command from the YugabyteDB root directory.

```sh
$ ./bin/ysqlsh
```

```
ysqlsh (11.2)
Type "help" for help.
yugabyte=#
```

### 3. Create the Chinook database

To create the `chinook` database, run the following command.

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# CREATE DATABASE chinook;
```

Confirm that you have the `chinook` database by using the `\l` command to list the databases on your cluster.

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# \l
```

Connect to the `chinook` database.

```plpgsql
yugabyte=# \c chinook
```

```
You are now connected to database "chinook" as user "yugabyte".
chinook=#
```

### 4. Build the tables and objects

To build the tables and database objects, run the following `\i` command.

```plpgsql
chinook=# \i share/chinook_ddl.sql
```

You can verify that all 11 tables have been created by running the `\d` command.

```plpgsql
chinook=# \d
```

### 5. Load the sample data

To load the `chinook` database with sample data, you need to run the SQL scripts.

First, run the SQL script to load the genres, artists, and albums.

```plpgsql
chinook=# \i share/chinook_genres_artists_albums.sql
```

Next, run the SQL script to load the songs.

```plpgsql
chinook=# \i share/chinook_songs.sql
```

Now verify that you have data by running a simple `SELECT` statement to pull some data from the `Track` table.

```plpgsql
chinook=# SELECT "Name", "Composer" FROM "Track" LIMIT 10;
```

```
              Name               |                          Composer
