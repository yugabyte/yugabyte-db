## 1. Are YugabyteDB processes running?

First, ensure that the expected YugabyteDB processes on the current node.
At a minimum, the tserver process needs to be running to be able to connect to this node with a YCQL client or application.
Additionally, depending on the setup, you might expect a master process to also be running on this node.
Follow the instructions on the [Check Processes](../../nodes/check-processes/) page.

## 2. Is the Cassandra-compatible YCQL API running?

If the tserver process is running, make sure the YCQL API is enabled and listening on the YCQL port (default `9042`).

```sh
$ lsof -i :9042
```

```
COMMAND     PID   USER   FD   TYPE     DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
yb-tserve 81590 centos  131u  IPv4 0xdeadbeef      0t0  TCP localhost:9042 (LISTEN)
```

Note: You may need to install `lsof` first.

When running a local cluster with `yb-ctl` you should see all the nodes here with different IP addresses. For instance:

```sh
$ lsof -i :9042
```

```
COMMAND     PID   USER   FD   TYPE     DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
yb-tserve 81590 centos  131u  IPv4 0xdeadbeef      0t0  TCP localhost:9042 (LISTEN)
yb-tserve 81593 centos  131u  IPv4 0xdeadbeef      0t0  TCP 127.0.0.2:9042 (LISTEN)
yb-tserve 81596 centos  131u  IPv4 0xdeadbeef      0t0  TCP 127.0.0.3:9042 (LISTEN)
```

If there is another process using this port you might need to stop that and restart the YB-TServer process.
Otherwise, if no process is listening but the YB-TServer is running, check the value of the `--cql_proxy_bind_address` flag passed to the YB-TServer process.

## 3. Can ycqlsh connect locally?

Once on the machine where YugabyteDB is running, use `ycqlsh` to connect to the local YugabyteDB instance.
Depending on your installation, you may need to install `ycqlsh`, otherwise you can find it in the YugabyteDB `bin` directory.
Try running:

```sh
$ ycqlsh <yb-local-address>
```

where `<yb-local-address>` is the address where the YugabyteDB YCQL server is listening (for example, as returned by `lsof`). For instance, in the example above, it is `localhost` (or, additionally, `127.0.0.2` and `127.0.0.3` for the `yb-ctl` case).

If `ycqlsh` can connect, the issue is likely a network issue with the original client not being able to access this node where YugabyteDB is running. See also [Are Master or TServer endpoints accessible?](../../nodes/check-processes#cannot-access-master-or-tserver-endpoints).
