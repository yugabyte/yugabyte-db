## Remove an unresponsive node

If a VM or machine in a universe reaches its end of life and has unrecoverable hardware or other system (OS, disk, etc.) issues, it will be detected and displayed in the Yugabyte Platform console as an `Unreachable` node. The Raft consensus algorithm will ensure that other leaders will get elected for the underlying data shards. But, the universe is in a partially under-replicated scenario and will not be able to tolerate many more failures. So a quick remedy is needed.

So, for the `yb-15-node-actions-n3` node, you can use the **Actions** drop-down list at the end and choose the **Remove Node** option. This will bring the node to the `Removed` status and no further data can be accessed from this node as server processes are shut down.

Note that there is no `MASTER/TSERVER` shown for that node. If that node was the `Master Leader`, then a Raft election will move it to another node quickly. Similar leader elections happen for tablets for which this node was the the leader tablet server.

### Release a node instance

Because you know that the instance is dead, you can go ahead and release the IP address using the **Actions** drop-down list to select the **Release Instance** option at the end of the Removed node. It will show up as a `Decommissioned` node.
