This section will describe how to create a universe that includes both a primary cluster and a [read replica](../../../architecture/docdb-replication/replication/#read-only-replicas) cluster in a hybrid cloud deployment, as well as dynamically add, edit, and remove a read replica cluster. In this example, you are first going to deploy a universe with primary cluster in Oregon (US-West) and read replica cluster in Northern Virginia (US-East).

## Create the universe

First, enter the following values to create a primary cluster on [GCP](../../configure-yugabyte-platform/set-up-cloud-provider/gcp) provider. Click **Create Universe** and then enter the following intent.

- Enter a universe name: **helloworld3**
- Enter the set of regions: **Oregon**
- Enter the replication factor: **3**
- Change instance type: **n1-standard-8**
- Add the following configuration flag for YB-Master and YB-TServer: `leader_failure_max_missed_heartbeat_periods = 10`. Since the the data is globally replicated, RPC latencies are higher. You can use this flag to increase the failure detection interval in such a higher RPC latency deployment.

Then, click **Configure Read Replica** and then enter the following intent to create a read replica
cluster on [AWS](../../configure-yugabyte-platform/set-up-cloud-provider/aws/).

- Enter the set of regions: **US East**
- Enter the replication factor: **3**
- Change the instance type: **c4.large**

Since you do not need to a establish a quorum for read replica clusters, the replication factor can be
either even or odd. Click **Create**.

## Examine the universe

While waiting for the universe to get created, it should look like this:

Once the universe is created, you should see something like this in the **Universe Overview** tab.

Note how you have a distinguished primary and read replica cluster defined, designated by the yellow and green groups respectively.

### Universe nodes

You can browse to the **Nodes** tab of the universe to see a list of nodes. Note that the nodes are grouped by primary or read replica, and read replica nodes have a `readonly1` identifier associated with the name.

Go to the cloud provider's instances page. In GCP, browse to **Compute Engine -> VM Instances** and search for instances that have `helloworld3` in their name. You should see something as follows, corresponding to our primary cluster.

In AWS, browse to **Instances** and do the same search, you should see three nodes corresponding to our read
replica cluster.

We have successfully created a hybrid cloud deployment with the primary cluster in GCP
and the read replica cluster in AWS!

## Add, remove, edit a read replica cluster

This section covers dynamically adding, editing, and removing a read replica cluster from an
existing universe. Let's create a new universe `helloworld4` with a primary cluster exactly as `helloworld3` but without any read replica cluster. Click **Create** and wait for the universe to be ready. Once this is done,
navigate to the **Overview** tab, and find the **More** drop-down list in the top right corner. There you should
find the **Configure Read Replica** selection and click on that.

![Configure Read Replica Dropdown](/images/ee/configure-read-replica-dropdown.png)

You will see a page to configure the read replica cluster. Enter the same intent you used for the
read replica cluster in `helloworld3` and click **Add Read Replica**.

![Configure Read Replica Page](/images/ee/configure-read-replica-page.png)

Once this is done, go to the **Nodes** tab and verify that you have three new read replica nodes, all in AWS.
To edit the read replica cluster, go back to the **More** dropdown and select **Configure Read Replica**. Add a
node to the cluster (it will automatically select an Availability Zone to select from) and click
**Edit Read Replica**.

![Edit Read Replica](/images/ee/edit-read-replica.png)

Once the universe is ready, go to the **Nodes** tab and you can see the new read replica node for a
total of four new nodes.

![Edit Read Replica Nodes](/images/ee/add-rr-4-nodes.png)

Finally, to delete the read replica cluster, go back to the **Configure Read Replica** page and click **Delete
this configuration**. You will be prompted to enter the universe name for safety purposes. Do this and press **Yes**.

![Delete Read Replica](/images/ee/configure-read-replica-delete.png)

Once this is done, go back to the **Nodes** page and verify that you only see the three primary nodes from
the initial universe creation. You have dynamically added, edited, and removed a read replica
cluster from an existing universe.
