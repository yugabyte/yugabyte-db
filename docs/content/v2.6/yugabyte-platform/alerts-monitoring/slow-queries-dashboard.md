Use the Slow Queries dashboard to analyze statistics of past queries on your YugabyteDB universes. You can use this data to:

- Visually identify slower running database operations
- Evaluate query execution times over time
- Discover potential queries for memory optimization

All user roles — `Super Admin`, `Admin`, and `Read-only` — are granted access to use the Slow Queries dashboard.

Note that slow queries are not available for YCQL.

## Use the **Slow Queries** dashboard

1. Go to the **Universe Details** page and from the **Queries** tab, select **Slow Queries**.

2. Clicking the 'x' will close the alert that slow queries are not available on YCQL. The Column Display allows for dynamically displaying specific fields.

3. Clicking the minimize icon will hide away the Column Display, allowing for more space to examine the query rows.

4. Click the search bar and the column filter drop-down list appears. The column filter drop-down list lets you use a query language for filtering data based on certain fields.

Use filtering for comparisons on numbers columns (`Avg Time`) using `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `<=` to search for values that are greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, and less than or equal to another value (`Avg Time: < 30`). You can also use the range syntax `n..m` to search for values within a range, where the first number `n` is the lowest value and the second number `m` is the highest value. The range syntax supports tokens like the following: `n..*` which is equivalent to `>= n`. Or `*..n` which is the same as `<= n`.

5. Click on a row to open a sidebar with a full view of the query statement, along with all the column data.

You can also find additional prefiltered navigation links from different pages to the **Slow Queries** page.

* Example: From the **Overview** tab to the **Queries** tab, when the user clicks the link to "Top SQL Statements".

* Example: The **Nodes** page each node's Actions contains a link to the **Slow Queries** page.
