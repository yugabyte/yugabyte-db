Use the Live Queries dashboard to monitor and display current running queries on your YugabyteDB universes. You can use this data to:

- Visually identify relevant database operations
- Evaluate query execution times
- Discover potential queries for performance optimization

All user roles — `Super Admin`, `Admin`, and `Read-only` — are granted access to use the Live Queries dashboard.

There is no significant performance overhead on databases because the queries are fetched on-demand and are not tracked in the background.

| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Node Name                  | The YB-TServer node name generated by Yugabyte Platform      |
| Private IP                 | The IP Address of the database node                          |
| Keyspace/Database:         | The YCQL keyspace or YSQL database used by the query         |
| Session status [YSQL only] | The YSQL session status: `idle`, `active`, `idle in transaction`, `fastpath function call`, `idle in transaction (aborted)`, or `disabled` |
| Query                      | The query command. Example: `select * from my_keyspace.my_table` |
| Elapsed time               | The duration (in milliseconds) of the query handling         |
| Type [YCQL only]           | Shows the YCQL query type: PREPARE, EXECUTE, QUERY, or BATCH |
| Client host                | The address of the client that sent this query               |
| Client port                | The port of the client that sent this query                  |

## Use the **Live Queries** dashboard

1. Go to the **Universe Details** page and from the **Show live queries** drop-down list, select **YSQL****.

2. Changing the **Show live queries** drop-down selection to **YCQL** will refresh the data and alter the column headers.

3. Click the search bar and the column filter drop-down list appears. The column filter drop-down list lets you use a query language for filtering data based on certain fields.

4. You can add multiple search terms that are applied as an intersection. In the following example, adding `Node Name` will filter for all rows with a name containing `puppy-food` and have a `UniqueSecondaryIndex` somewhere in one of the data cells.

Use filtering for comparisons on numbers columns (`Elapsed Time`) using `>`, `>=`, `<`, and `<=` to search for values that are greater than, greater than or equal to, less than, and less than or equal to another value (Elapsed Time: `< 50`).  You can also use the range syntax `n..n` to search for values within a range, where the first number `n` is the lowest value and the second `n` is the highest value. The range syntax supports tokens like the following: `n..*` which is equivalent to `>= n`. Or `*..n` which is the same as `<= n`.

5. Click on a row to open a sidebar with a full view of the query statement, along with all the column data.

You can also find additional prefiltered navigation links from different pages to the **Live Queries** page.

* Example: From the **Metrics** tab to the **Queries** tab, when the user selects a node from the drop-down list.

* Example: The **Nodes** page to link to the **Live Queries** page, with the specific node prefiltered.
