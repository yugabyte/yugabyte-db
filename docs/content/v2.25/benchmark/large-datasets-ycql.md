{{<api-tabs list="ycql">}}

Use this benchmark to understand the performance, failure, and scaling characteristics of YugabyteDB with a massive dataset (multiple TB per node). In order to accomplish that, you will do the following:

- Load 30 billion key-value records
- Each write operation inserts a single record
- Perform a read-heavy workload that does *random reads* in the presence of some writes
- Perform a read-heavy workload that does *reads of a subset of data* in the presence of some writes

Each record is a key-value record of size almost 300 bytes.

- **Key size:** 50 Bytes
- **Value size:** 256 Bytes (chosen to be not very compressible)

## Recommended configuration

Note that the load tester was run from a separate machine in the same availability zone (AZ).

### Machine types

A machine in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud with the following specifications was chosen: **32-vcpus, 240 GB RAM, 4 x 1.9TB nvme SSD**.

- **Cloud:** AWS
- **Node type:** i3.8xlarge

### Cluster creation

Create a standard four-node cluster, with replication factor (RF) of `3`. Pass the following option to the YugabyteDB processes.

```sh
--yb_num_shards_per_tserver=20
```

The `yb_num_shards_per_tserver` was set to `20` (default value is `8`). This is done because the `i3.8xlarge` nodes have four disks. In future, YugabyteDB will automatically pick better defaults for nodes with multiple disks.

Create the `YCQL_ADDRS` environment variable using the `export` command:

```sh
$ export YCQL_ADDRS="<ip1>:9042,<ip2>:9042,<ip3>:9042,<ip4>:9042"
```

## Initial load phase

The data was loaded at a steady rate over about 4 days using the `CassandraKeyValue` workload. To load the data, run the following command:

```sh
$ java -jar yb-sample-apps.jar        \
      --workload CassandraKeyValue    \
      --nouuid --nodes $YCQL_ADDRS    \
      --value_size 256                \
      --num_unique_keys 30000000000   \
      --num_writes 30000000000        \
      --num_threads_write 256         \
      --num_threads_read 1
```

### Write IOPS

You should see a steady 85,000 inserts per second with write latencies of around 2.5 milliseconds. This is shown graphically below.

### Data set size growth rate

The graph below shows the steady growth in `SSTables` size at a node from `Sep 4` to `Sep 7` beyond which it stabilizes at `6.5 TB`.

## Final data set size

The following illustration is from the yb-master Admin UI that shows the tablet servers, number of tablets on each, number of tablet leaders, and size of the on-disk `SSTable` files.

{{< note title="Note" >}}

The uncompressed dataset size per node is 8 TB, while the compressed size is 6.5 TB. This is because the load generator generates random bytes, which are not very compressible.

Real world workloads generally have much more compressible data.

## Expected results

The results you see should be similar to the observations shown below.

### Load phase results

| Name | Observation |
| :--- | :---------- |
| Records inserted | 30 Billion |
| Size of each record | ~ 300 bytes |
| Time taken to insert data | 4.4 days |
| Sustained insert Rate | 85K inserts/second |
| Final dataset in cluster | 26TB across 4 nodes |
| Final dataset size per node | 6.5TB / node |

### Read-heavy workload results

| Name | Observation |
| :--- | :---------- |
| Random-data read heavy workload | 185K reads/sec and 1K writes/sec |
| Recent-data read heavy Workload | 385K reads/sec and 6.5K writes/sec |

### Cluster expansion and induced failures

- Expanded from four to five nodes in about eight hours
  - Deliberately rate limited at `200 MB/sec`
- New node takes traffic as soon the first tablet arrives
  - Pressure relieved from old nodes very quickly
- Induced one node failure in five-node cluster
  - Cluster rebalanced in `2 hrs 10 minutes`
