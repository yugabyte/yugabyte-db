You can export [cluster metrics](../overview/) to third-party tools for analysis and customization.

Metrics export is not available for Sandbox clusters.

Exporting metrics may incur costs for network transfer, especially for cross-region and internet-based transfers. Refer to [Data transfer costs](../../cloud-admin/cloud-billing-costs/#data-transfer-costs).

## Prerequisites

Create an export configuration. A configuration defines the sign in credentials and settings for the tool that you want to export your logs to. Refer to [Integrations](../managed-integrations).

## Export cluster metrics

To enable metrics export for a cluster, do the following:

1. On the cluster **Settings** tab, select **Export Metrics**.
1. Click **Export Metrics**.
1. Select the [export configuration](../managed-integrations/) for the tool you want to export to.
1. Click **Export Metrics**.

To modify the metrics export configuration, on the cluster **Settings** tab, select **Edit Metrics Export Configuration** and choose a different Export Configuration.

To pause or resume metrics export from a cluster, on the cluster **Settings** tab, select **Edit Metrics Export Configuration** and choose **Pause Metrics Export** or **Resume Metrics Export**.

To remove metrics export from a cluster, on the cluster **Settings** tab, select **Edit Metrics Export Configuration** and choose **Disable Metrics Export**.
