## Labs

The following lab is available (with more in development).

### Create Global Applications

Learn how you can minimize application latencies for users in widely dispersed geographies using [read replicas](../cloud-basics/create-clusters-topology/#read-replicas) and [partition by region](../cloud-basics/create-clusters-topology/#partition-by-region) deployments.
