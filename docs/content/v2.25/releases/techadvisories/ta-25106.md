## Description

### Background

[DocDB packed row format](../../../architecture/docdb/packed-rows/) has a dependency on the schema version in order to read rows. If a table undergoes schema change, then the older schema versions are kept around as long as there are [Sorted String Tables (SSTs)](../../../architecture/docdb/lsm-sst/#sst) that refer to the older schema versions. These schema versions cannot be kept around forever as compactions garbage collect the unused schema versions metadata. The schema versions for each SST file is stored in frontiers.

### Problem

When a large transaction inserts rows into a table, the data may be split into multiple [RocksDB](https://rocksdb.org/) batches, each potentially flushing independently into separate SST files (for example, File A, File B, and File C). The current issue is that _only the last batch_ updates the schema version in the frontier.

This behavior can lead to aggressive garbage collection of schema version and packing metadata under specific conditions:

- A schema version change occurs after earlier batches (for example, File A and File B) have been flushed.
- Files containing the schema packing metadata (for example, File C) are compacted independently, allowing the garbage collection mechanism to remove this metadata.

While this scenario is rare, it has been observed in lab stress tests.

**Necessary conditions**

It requires the confluence of YSQL (with Packed Row which is GA only for YSQL), schema modification operations, large transactions, and subsequent compaction that selectively processes later SST files (if all the files A, B and C were compacted together, then there would not be any issue).

**Error**

[TServer](../../../architecture/yb-tserver/) fatals with schema packing not found error. The TServer logs would contain logs like "Cannot find packing with version 0 for table â€¦" as follows:

## Mitigation

- If a single replica of a tablet is affected by this issue within a cluster ([Replication Factor](../../../architecture/key-concepts/#replication-factor-rf) 3 or greater), the problem can be resolved by removing the affected tablet. [Raft](../../../architecture/docdb-replication/raft/) will then replicate a healthy copy from the remaining replicas.

- A general workaround is to set the TServer flag [enable_schema_packing_gc](../../../reference/configuration/all-flags-yb-tserver/#enable-schema-packing-gc) to false. While this action causes schema metadata to be retained indefinitely, the associated storage cost is minimal (calculated as: number_of_schema_changes_for_the_table * number_of_tablets_for_table * size_of_schema). This retained metadata will be reclaimed once the `enable_schema_packing_gc` flag is reset to true.

- In scenarios where all replicas of a tablet encounter this failure, self-remediation is not possible. Please contact {{% support-general %}} for assistance.

## Details

The issue was fixed by adding the missing call to `FlushSchemaVersion` when writing the intermediate transaction batch as part of {{<issue 25106>}}.
