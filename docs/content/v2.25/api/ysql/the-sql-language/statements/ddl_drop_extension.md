## Synopsis

Use the `DROP EXTENSION` statement to remove an extension from the database.

## Syntax

{{%ebnf%}}
  drop_extension
{{%/ebnf%}}

## Semantics

- An error is thrown if the extension does not exist unless `IF EXISTS` is
  used. Then, a notice is issued instead.
- `RESTRICT` is the default, and it will not drop the extension if any objects
  depend on it.
- `CASCADE` drops any objects that transitively depend on the extension.

## Examples

```plpgsql
DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS cube;
```

```output
NOTICE:  extension "cube" does not exist, skipping
```

```plpgsql
CREATE EXTENSION cube;
CREATE EXTENSION earthdistance;
DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS cube RESTRICT;
```

```output
ERROR:  cannot drop extension cube because other objects depend on it
DETAIL:  extension earthdistance depends on function cube_out(cube)
HINT:  Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.
```

```plpgsql
DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS cube CASCADE;
```

```output
NOTICE:  drop cascades to extension earthdistance
DROP EXTENSION
```
