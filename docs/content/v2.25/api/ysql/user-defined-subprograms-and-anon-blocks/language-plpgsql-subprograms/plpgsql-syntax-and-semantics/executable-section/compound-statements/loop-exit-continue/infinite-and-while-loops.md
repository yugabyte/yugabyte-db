This page describes the two kinds of _unbounded_ loop.

## "Infinite loop"

The _infinite loop_ is the most basic and most flexible form of the _[unbounded loop](../../../../../../../syntax_resources/grammar_diagrams/#plpgsql-unbounded-loop-defn)_. It looks like this:

```plpgsql
<<label_17>>loop
  <statement list 1>
  exit <label> when <boolean expression>;
  <statement list 2>
end loop label_17;
```

or this:

```plpgsql
<<label_17>>loop
  <statement list 1>
  continue label_17 when <boolean expression 1>;
  <statement list 2>
  exit label_17 when <boolean expression 2>;
  <statement list 3>
end loop label_17;
```

An _infinite loop_ must have either an _exit_ statement (or, though these are rare practices, a _return_ statement or a _raise exception_ statement). Otherwise, it will simply iterate forever.

Try this example:

```plpgsql
\c :db :u
drop schema if exists s cascade;
create schema s;
create table s.t(k serial primary key, v int not null);
insert into s.t(v) select generate_series(0, 99, 5);

create function s.f_infinite(k_lo in int, k_hi in int)
  returns table(k int, v int)
  set search_path = pg_catalog, pg_temp
  language plpgsql
as $body$
declare
  cur refcursor not null := 'cur';
begin
  open cur no scroll for (
    select t.k, t.v
    from s.t
    where t.k between k_lo and k_hi
    order by t.k);

  -- Infinite loop -----------------------------------------
  loop
    fetch next from cur into k, v;
    exit when not found;
    return next;
  end loop;
  ----------------------------------------------------------

close cur;
end;
$body$;

select k, v from s.f_infinite(6, 11);
```

The code relies on these basic PL/pgSQL statements:

- _[plpgsql_open_cursor_stmt](../../../../../../../syntax_resources/grammar_diagrams/#plpgsql-open-cursor-stmt)_
- _[plpgsql_fetch_from_cursor_stmt](../../../../../../../syntax_resources/grammar_diagrams/#plpgsql-fetch-from-cursor-stmt)_
- _[plpgsql_close_cursor_stmt](../../../../../../../syntax_resources/grammar_diagrams/#plpgsql-close-cursor-stmt)_

See also the section **[Cursor manipulation in PL/pgSQL](../../../basic-statements/cursor-manipulation/)**.

This is the result:

```outout
 k  | v  
----+----
  6 | 25
  7 | 30
  8 | 35
  9 | 40
 10 | 45
 11 | 50
```

Notice the use of the special built-in variable _found_. (This is described in the section [The "get diagnostics" statement](../../../../executable-section/basic-statements/get-diagnostics/).)

See also the section [Beware Issue #6514](../../../../../../../cursors/#beware-issue-6514) at the end of the [Cursors](../../../../../../../cursors/) section. Because of the current restrictions that it describes, and because of the fact that _fetch all_ is anyway not supported in PL/pgSQL in vanilla PostgreSQL, the only viable cursor operation in PL/pgSQL besides _open_ and _close_ is _fetch next... into_. Given this, the _while loop_ approach for iterating over the results of a query shown here adds no value over what the _[query for loop](../query-for-loop/)_ brings.

## "While loop"

The other form of the _[unbounded loop](../../../../../../../syntax_resources/grammar_diagrams/#plpgsql-unbounded-loop-defn)_ is the _while loop_. It looks like this:

```plpgsql
<<label_42>>while <boolean expression> loop
  <statement list>
end loop label_42;
```

The _boolean_ expression is evaluated before starting an iteration. If it evaluates to _false_, then no iteration takes place—just if the loop was written as an _infinite loop_ and _exit when not \<boolean expression\>_ were written as the very first statement inside the loop. Otherwise, the code inside the loop had better change the outcome of the _boolean_ expression so that it eventually becomes _false_.

This form is sometimes referred to as the _pre-tested loop_ because it checks the condition before executing each next iteration.

In this example, _label_42_ isn't mentioned in an _exit_ statement or a _continue_ statement. But the name used at the end of the _loop_ statement must anyway match the name used at its start. (If they don't match, then you get the _42601_ syntax error.)

{{< tip title="Label all loops." >}}
Many programmers recommend labelling all loops and argue that doing so improves the code's readability—precisely because the syntax check guarantees that you can be certain where a _loop_ statement ends, even when it extends over many lines and even if the author has made a mistake with the indentation.
{{< /tip >}}

As an exercise, re-write the code example from the **["infinite loop](./#infinite-loop-over-cursor-results)** section, above, to use a while loop, thus:

```plpgsql
create function s.f_while(k_lo in int, k_hi in int)
  returns table(k int, v int)
  set search_path = pg_catalog, pg_temp
  language plpgsql
as $body$
declare
  cur refcursor not null := 'cur';
begin
  open cur no scroll for (
    select t.k, t.v
    from s.t
    where t.k between k_lo and k_hi
    order by t.k);
    
  -- While loop --------------------------------------------
  fetch next from cur into k, v;
  while found loop
    return next;
    fetch next from cur into k, v;
  end loop;
  ----------------------------------------------------------
  
  close cur;
end;
$body$;

select k, v from s.f_while(6, 11);
```

It produces exactly the same result as does _s.f_infinite()_. Notice that the _infinite loop_ and the _while loop_ each uses the same number, _five_, of code lines. Stylists debate which version is nicer—and the choice is determined by taste. Very often, the _while loop_ requires some code before the loop to establish the starting condition. And in this case, _fetch next from cur into k, v_ is written twice: both before the loop and inside it. In contrast, with the _infinite loop_, it's written just once. The code inside the _while loop_ ("print the result from the previous iteration and then get the next result") feels back-to-front in comparison with the _infinite loop_'s "get the next result and print it". Sometimes, depending on the use case, the _while loop_ feels like the better choice.

Notice that this is legal:

```plpgsql
<<strange>>while true loop
  <statement list>
  continue <label> when <boolean expression>;
  <statement list>
  exit <label> when <boolean expression>;
  <statement list>
end loop strange;
```

However, the effect of writing _"while true loop"_ is indistinguishable from the effect of writing just _"loop"_. Using the verbose form is therefore pointless; and it's likely that doing so will simply confuse the reader.
