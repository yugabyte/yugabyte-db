**Purpose:** Return a new array where _every_ occurrence of the specified value has been removed from the specified input array.

**Signature:**
```
input value:       anyarray, anyelement
return value:      anyarray
```
**Note:** This function requires the array from which values are to be removed is one-dimensional. This restriction is understood in light of the fact that arrays are rectilinearâ€”in other words, the geometry of an array whose dimensionality is two or more is fixed at creation time. For examples illustrating this rule, see [array_fill()](../array-fill).

**Example:**
```plpgsql
create table t(k int primary key, arr int[]);
insert into t(k, arr)
values (1, '{1, 2, 2, 2, 5, 6}'::int[]);

select arr as "old value of arr" from t where k = 1;

update t
set arr = array_remove(arr, 2)
where k = 1;

select arr as "new value of arr" from t where k = 1;
```
This is the result of the two queries:
```
 old value of arr
------------------
 {1,2,2,2,5,6}

 new value of arr
------------------
 {1,5,6}
```
