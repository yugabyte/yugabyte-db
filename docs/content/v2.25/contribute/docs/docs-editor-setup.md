## Extensions

To install an extension in Visual Studio Code, click the Extensions icon in the left nav, or press Cmd-Shift-X, and search for the extension by name.

## Extensions to make doc writing easier

* **GitHub Pull Requests and Issues**, by GitHub: Pretty good pull request support. Not perfect, and can get confused with large PRs, but handy on a regular basis.

* **GitLens â€” Git supercharged**, by Eric Amodio: Useful Git tooling, including per-line blame/history.

* **Markdown Preview Enhanced**, by Yiyi Wang: Even nicer Markdown previews.

* **markdownlint**, by David Anson: Lints your markdown formatting to catch errors and inconsistencies.

* **Vale**, by errata-ai: Prose linter. Very powerful, very extensible. (Also available [for Atom](https://atom.io/packages/atomic-vale)). Be sure to turn on "Vale > Core: Use CLI" in your Visual Studio Code settings.

* **Sort Lines**, by Daniel Imms: Adds better sorting options. In particular, natural sort order for strings makes [10] come after [9].

## Extensions for better language support

Use these as necessary. If you don't need a particular extension, don't install it.

* **Better TOML**, by bungcip: Makes reading Netlify configuration files nicer.

* **Dart**, by Dart Code

* **Docker**, by Microsoft

* **ESLint**, by Dirk Baeumer: The JavaScript linter.

* **Flutter**, by Dart Code

* **Spectral**, by Stoplight: Lints OpenAPI specs and any other YAML/JSON you want.

* **YAML**, by Red Hat
