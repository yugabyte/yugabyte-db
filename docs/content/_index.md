YugabyteDB is a high-performance distributed SQL database for powering global, internet-scale applications. Built using a combination of high-performance document store, per-shard distributed consensus replication, and multi-shard ACID transactions, YugabyteDB serves both scale-out RDBMS and internet-scale OLTP workloads with low query latency, extreme resilience against failures, and global data distribution. As a cloud-native database, it can be deployed across public and private clouds as well as in Kubernetes environments.

YugabyteDB is a good fit for fast-growing, cloud native applications that need to serve business-critical data reliably, with zero data loss, high availability, and low latency.
