[Yugastore](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugastore) app is a sample ecommerce application built using a microservices design pattern. React UI, Node.js Express app framework and YugabyteDB (YCQL and YEDIS) are used as the underlying technology stack.

## 1. Create a cluster

Create a cluster. The YEDIS API is initialized along with cluster creation so nothing additional needs to be done.

```sh
$ ./yb-docker-ctl -rf 3 create
```

Clients can now connect to the YSQL API at `localhost:5433`, YCQL API at `localhost:9042`, and YEDIS API at  `localhost:6379`.

## 2. Install Yugastore

```sh
$ docker run -p 3001:3001 -d --network yb-net --name yugastore yugabytedb/yugastore
```

You can see the Yugastore app at http://localhost:3001.

## 3. Run a load tester

```sh
$ docker exec -it yugastore node /usr/local/yugastore/test/sample-user.js
```

## 4. Observe effects of load on YugabyteDB Admin UI

Now you can observe the effects of the read/write operations generated by the load tester by simply going to the YugabyteDB Admin UI at http://localhost:7000.

## 5. Review Yugastore architecture and code

Details of Yugastore architecture are documented [here](../../develop/realworld-apps/ecommerce-app/). Source code is available in the [Yugastore GitHub repo](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugastore).

## 6. Run IoT Fleet Management app

After running Yugastore, run the [IoT Fleet Management](../realworld-apps/iot-spark-kafka-ksql/) app. This app is built on top of YugabyteDB as the database (using the YCQL API), Confluent Kafka as the message broker, KSQL or Apache Spark Streaming for real-time analytics and Spring Boot as the application framework.
