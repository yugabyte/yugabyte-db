Typically, troubleshooting involves a number of steps that are rather consistent regardless of the particular situation. These steps include the following:

1. Verify that YugabyteDB is running: you need to ensure that the expected YugabyteDB processes are running on the current node. At a minimum, the YB-TServer process must be running to be able to connect to the node with a client or application.

    Additionally, depending on the setup, you might expect a YB-Master process to run on this node.

    For more information, see [Check servers](nodes/check-processes/).

2. Check [cluster-level issues](cluster/) and their solutions.

3. Check logs: you should inspect the YugabyteDB logs for additional details on your issue. For more information, see [Inspect logs](nodes/check-logs/).

4. Explore knowledge base articles: you can find additional troubleshooting resources and information on Yugabyte [Support page](https://support.yugabyte.com/).

5. File an issue: if you can't find a solution to your problem, file a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues) describing your specific problem.
