* **Python** (v3.10 or earlier): You need `python` to be available somewhere in your shell path.

    Recent versions of Ubuntu default to `python` and point to Python 3. If not, you can install a new version of Python, and use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage multiple Python versions. Ensure you're using Python 3.10 or earlier.

* **Hugo**: Install the `hugo_extended_0.125.6` version from the [official Hugo releases](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases) for your Linux machine architecture. Make sure the `hugo` binary is available in the shell path.

* **Go**: Install latest Go from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

* **Git client**: Ubuntu includes Git by default, but ensure you have the latest version (`sudo apt-get install git`).
