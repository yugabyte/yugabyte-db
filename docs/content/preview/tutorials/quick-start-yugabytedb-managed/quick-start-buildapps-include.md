The [Java application](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-simple-java-app) connects to a YugabyteDB cluster using the topology-aware [Yugabyte JDBC driver](/preview/drivers-orms/java/) and performs basic SQL operations. Use the application as a template to get started with YugabyteDB in Java.

The application requires the following:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.8, or later, is installed. JDK installers for Linux and macOS can be downloaded from [Oracle](http://jdk.java.net/), [Adoptium (OpenJDK)](https://adoptium.net/), or [Azul Systems (OpenJDK)](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk). Homebrew users on macOS can install using `brew install openjdk`.
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html) 3.3 or later.

To build and run the application, do the following:

1. Clone the sample application to your computer:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YugabyteDB-Samples/yugabyte-simple-java-app.git && cd yugabyte-simple-java-app
    ```

1. Provide connection parameters.

    (You can skip this step and use the defaults if your cluster is running locally and listening on 127.0.0.1:5433.)

    The application needs to establish a connection to the YugabyteDB cluster. To do this:

    - Open the `app.properties` file located in the application `src/main/resources/` folder.

    - Set the following configuration parameters:

        - **host** - the host name of your YugabyteDB cluster. For local clusters, use the default (127.0.0.1). For YugabyteDB Aeon, select your cluster on the **Clusters** page, and click **Settings**. The host is displayed under **Connection Parameters**.
        - **port** - the port number for the driver to use (the default YugabyteDB YSQL port is 5433).
        - **database** - the name of the database you are connecting to (the default is `yugabyte`).
        - **dbUser** and **dbPassword** - the username and password for the YugabyteDB database. For local clusters, use the defaults (`yugabyte`). For YugabyteDB Aeon, use the credentials in the credentials file you downloaded.

    - YugabyteDB Aeon [requires SSL connections](/preview/yugabyte-cloud/cloud-secure-clusters/cloud-authentication/#ssl-modes-in-ysql), so you need to set the following additional parameters:

        - **sslMode** - the SSL mode to use; use `verify-full`.
        - **sslRootCert** - the full path to the YugabyteDB Aeon [cluster CA certificate](/preview/yugabyte-cloud/cloud-secure-clusters/cloud-authentication/).

    - Save the file.

1. Build the application.

    ```sh
    $ mvn clean package
    ```

1. Start the application.

    ```sh
    $ java -cp target/yugabyte-simple-java-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar SampleApp
    ```

If you are running the application on a free or single node cluster, the driver displays a warning that the load balance failed and will fall back to a regular connection.

You should see output similar to the following:

```output
>>>> Successfully connected to YugabyteDB!
>>>> Successfully created DemoAccount table.
>>>> Selecting accounts:
name = Jessica, age = 28, country = USA, balance = 10000
name = John, age = 28, country = Canada, balance = 9000

>>>> Transferred 800 between accounts.
>>>> Selecting accounts:
name = Jessica, age = 28, country = USA, balance = 9200
name = John, age = 28, country = Canada, balance = 9800

        - **port** - the port number for the driver to use (the default YugabyteDB YSQL port is 5433).
        - **dbname** - the name of the database you are connecting to (the default is `yugabyte`).
        - **user** and **password** - the username and password for the YugabyteDB database. For local clusters, use the defaults (`yugabyte`). For YugabyteDB Aeon, use the credentials in the credentials file you downloaded.

    - YugabyteDB Aeon [requires SSL connections](/preview/yugabyte-cloud/cloud-secure-clusters/cloud-authentication/#ssl-modes-in-ysql), so you need to set the following additional parameters:

        - **sslmode** - the SSL mode to use; use `verify-full`.
        - **sslrootcert** - the full path to the YugabyteDB Aeon [cluster CA certificate](/preview/yugabyte-cloud/cloud-secure-clusters/cloud-authentication/).

    - Save the file.

1. Make the application file executable.

    ```sh
    chmod +x sample-app.rb
    ```

1. Run the application.

    ```sh
    $ ./sample-app.rb
    ```

You should see output similar to the following:

```output
>>>> Successfully connected to YugabyteDB!
>>>> Successfully created table DemoAccount.
>>>> Selecting accounts:

The [Rust application](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-simple-rust-app) connects to a YugabyteDB cluster using the [Rust-Postgres driver](/preview/drivers-orms/rust/yb-rust-postgres/) and performs basic SQL operations. Use the application as a template to get started with YugabyteDB in Rust.

The application requires the following:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) development environment. The sample application was created for Rust 1.58 but should work for earlier and later versions.

To build and run the application, do the following:

1. Clone the sample application to your computer:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YugabyteDB-Samples/yugabyte-simple-rust-app.git && cd yugabyte-simple-rust-app
    ```

1. Provide connection parameters.

    (You can skip this step and use the defaults if your cluster is running locally and listening on 127.0.0.1:5433.)

    The application needs to establish a connection to the YugabyteDB cluster. To do this:

    - Open the `sample-app.rs` file in the `src` directory.

    - Set the following configuration-related constants:

        - **HOST** - the host name of your YugabyteDB cluster. For local clusters, use the default (127.0.0.1). For YugabyteDB Aeon, select your cluster on the **Clusters** page, and click **Settings**. The host is displayed under **Connection Parameters**.
        - **PORT** - the port number for the driver to use (the default YugabyteDB YSQL port is 5433).
        - **DB_NAME** - the name of the database you are connecting to (the default is `yugabyte`).
        - **USER** and **PASSWORD** - the username and password for the YugabyteDB database. For local clusters, use the defaults (`yugabyte`). For YugabyteDB Aeon, use the credentials in the credentials file you downloaded.

    - YugabyteDB Aeon [requires SSL connections](/preview/yugabyte-cloud/cloud-secure-clusters/cloud-authentication/#ssl-modes-in-ysql), so you need to set the following additional parameters:

        - **SSL_MODE** - the SSL mode to use; use `SslMode::Require`.
        - **SSL_ROOT_CERT** - the full path to the YugabyteDB Aeon [cluster CA certificate](/preview/yugabyte-cloud/cloud-secure-clusters/cloud-authentication/).

    - Save the file.

1. Build and run the application.

    ```sh
    $ cargo run
    ```

The driver is included in the dependencies list of the `Cargo.toml` file and installed automatically the first time you run the application.

You should see output similar to the following:

```output
>>>> Successfully connected to YugabyteDB!
>>>> Successfully created table DemoAccount.
>>>> Selecting accounts:
name = Jessica, age = 28, country = USA, balance = 10000
name = John, age = 28, country = Canada, balance = 9000

The [PHP application](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-simple-php-app) connects to a YugabyteDB cluster using the [php-pgsql](/preview/drivers-orms/php/ysql/) driver and performs basic SQL operations. Use the application as a template to get started with YugabyteDB in PHP.

The application requires the following:

- PHP runtime. The sample application was created using PHP 8.1 but should work with earlier and later versions. Homebrew users on macOS can install PHP using `brew install php`.
- [php-pgsql driver](/preview/drivers-orms/php/ysql/).
  - On macOS, Homebrew automatically installs the driver with `brew install php`.
  - Ubuntu users can install the driver using the `sudo apt-get install php-pgsql` command.
  - CentOS users can install the driver using the `sudo yum install php-pgsql` command.

To build and run the application, do the following:

1. Clone the sample application to your computer:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YugabyteDB-Samples/yugabyte-simple-php-app.git && cd yugabyte-simple-php-app
