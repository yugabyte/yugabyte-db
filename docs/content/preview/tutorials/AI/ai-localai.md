This tutorial shows how you can use [LocalAI](https://localai.io/) to create an interactive query interface. It features a Python application that uses a locally-running LLM to generate text-embeddings. This LLM generates embeddings for Wikipedia texts of popular programming languages, as well as user prompts. Embeddings for each programming language are stored in a YugabyteDB database using the [pgvector extension](../../../explore/ysql-language-features/pg-extensions/extension-pgvector/).

## Prerequisites

* YugabyteDB [v2.19.2 or later](https://download.yugabyte.com/)
* [LocalAI](https://localai.io/basics/getting_started/)
* Python 3
* Docker

## Set up the application

Download the application and provide settings specific to your deployment:

1. Clone the repository.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/YugabyteDB-Samples/yugabytedb-localai-programming-language-search.git
    ```

1. Install the application dependencies.

    Dependencies can be installed in a virtual environment, or globally on your machine.

    * Option 1 (recommended): Install Dependencies from *requirements.txt* in virtual environment.

        ```sh
        python3 -m venv yb-localai-env
        source yb-localai-env/bin/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        # NOTE: Users with M1 Mac machines should use requirements-m1.txt instead:
        # pip install -r requirements-m1.txt
        ```

    * Option 2: Install Dependencies Globally.

        ```sh
        pip install transformers
        pip install requests
        pip install wikipedia-api
        pip install psycopg2
        # NOTE: Users with M1 Mac machines should install the psycopg2 binary instead:
        # pip install psycopg2-binary
        pip install python-dotenv
        ```

1. Configure the application environment variables in `{project_directory/.env}`.

## Set up YugabyteDB

Start a 3-node YugabyteDB cluster in Docker (or feel free to use another deployment option):

```sh
# NOTE: if the ~/yb_docker_data already exists on your machine, delete and re-create it
mkdir ~/yb_docker_data

docker network create custom-network

docker run -d --name yugabytedb-node1 --net custom-network \
    -p 15433:15433 -p 7001:7000 -p 9001:9000 -p 5433:5433 \
    -v ~/yb_docker_data/node1:/home/yugabyte/yb_data --restart unless-stopped \
    yugabytedb/yugabyte:{{< yb-version version="preview" format="build">}} \
    bin/yugabyted start \
    --base_dir=/home/yugabyte/yb_data --background=false

docker run -d --name yugabytedb-node2 --net custom-network \
    -p 15434:15433 -p 7002:7000 -p 9002:9000 -p 5434:5433 \
    -v ~/yb_docker_data/node2:/home/yugabyte/yb_data --restart unless-stopped \
    yugabytedb/yugabyte:{{< yb-version version="preview" format="build">}} \
    bin/yugabyted start --join=yugabytedb-node1 \
    --base_dir=/home/yugabyte/yb_data --background=false

docker run -d --name yugabytedb-node3 --net custom-network \
    -p 15435:15433 -p 7003:7000 -p 9003:9000 -p 5435:5433 \
    -v ~/yb_docker_data/node3:/home/yugabyte/yb_data --restart unless-stopped \
    yugabytedb/yugabyte:{{< yb-version version="preview" format="build">}} \
    bin/yugabyted start --join=yugabytedb-node1 \
    --base_dir=/home/yugabyte/yb_data --background=false
```

The database connectivity settings are provided in the `{project_dir}/.env` file and do not need to be changed if you started the cluster with the preceding command.

Navigate to the YugabyteDB UI to confirm that the database is up and running, at <http://127.0.0.1:15433>.

## Get started with LocalAI

Running [LocalAI](https://localai.io/basics/getting_started/) on your machine, or on a virtual machine, requires sufficient hardware. Be sure to check the specifications before installation. This application uses Docker to run a BERT text-embedding model.

Execute the following command to run this model in Docker:

```sh
docker run -ti -p 8080:8080 localai/localai:v2.8.0-ffmpeg-core bert-cpp
```

The following output is generated, exposing a REST endpoint to interact with the LLM.

```output
...
You can test this model with curl like this:

curl http://localhost:8080/embeddings -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{
  "input": "Your text string goes here",
  "model": "bert-cpp-minilm-v6"
}'
```

## Load the schema and seed data

This application requires a database table with information about popular programming languages. This schema includes a `programming_languages` table.

1. Copy the schema to the first node's Docker container.

    ```sh
    docker cp {project_dir}/sql/schema.sql yugabytedb-node1:/home
    ```

1. Copy the seed data file to the Docker container.

    ```sh
    docker cp {project_dir}/sql/data.sql yugabytedb-node1:/home
    ```

1. Execute the SQL files against the database.

    ```sh
    docker exec -it yugabytedb-node1 bin/ysqlsh -h yugabytedb-node1 -f /home/schema.sql
    docker exec -it yugabytedb-node1 bin/ysqlsh -h yugabytedb-node1 -f /home/data.sql
    ```

## Start the application

This command-line application uses a locally-running LLM to produce text-embeddings for a user prompt. It takes an input in natural language and returns a response from YugabyteDB. By converting text to embeddings, a similarity search is executed using `pgvector`.

1. Start the server.

    ```sh
    python3 index.py
    ```

    ```output
    Enter a search for programming languages
    ```

1. Provide a relevant search term. For instance:

```output
Enter a search for programming languages: 

derivations of javascript
```

```output.js

```

## Review the application

The Python application relies on a BERT model, running in LocalAI, to generate text-embeddings for a user input. These embeddings are then used to query YugabyteDB using similarity search to generate a response.

```python
# index.py
from generate_embeddings import generate_embeddings_request
from database import execute_fetchall
import pprint as pp
def get_user_input():
    return input("Enter a search for programming languages: ")

def main():
    user_input = get_user_input()
    while user_input != None:
        json_response = generate_embeddings_request(user_input)
        embeddings = json_response["data"][0]["embedding"]
        results = execute_fetchall(embeddings=embeddings)
        pp.pprint(results)
        user_input = get_user_input()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

While the core application is quite straightforward, the script for generating embeddings for each programming language summary is a bit more interesting. The *fit_text* function ensures that the summary text sent to LocalAI will be within the token limits of the `bert-cpp-minilm-v6` model used to generate embeddings. Wikipedia pages are fetched in full, but embeddings are only generated on the first subset of characters. This is an imperfect approach, but serves as a reasonable example for working with a large language model.

```python
# generate_embeddings.py

def fit_text(input_text):
    # Tokenize the text
    tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(input_text)

    # The BERT models include special tokens [CLS] and [SEP], so we have to account for them

    # Check how many tokens can fit
    if len(tokens) > max_tokens:

        print(f"Only the first {len(fitting_tokens)} words/tokens can be sent to BERT for text embeddings.")
    else:
        print(f"All {len(tokens)} words/tokens can be sent to BERT for text embeddings.")

    # Optionally, convert tokens back to text to see what fits
    fitting_text = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_string(fitting_tokens if len(tokens) > max_tokens else tokens)
    print("Fitting text:", fitting_text)
    return fitting_text

                print(f"Generating embeddings for {language}")
                json_response = generate_embeddings_request(fit_text(text))
                print(json_response)
                embeddings = json_response["data"][0]["embedding"]

                db_connection = connect_to_db()
                insert_programming_language(db_connection, name=language, summary=text, embeddings=embeddings)
            finally:
                db_connection.close()

## Wrap-up

LocalAI allows you to use LLMs locally or on-premises, with a wide array of models.
