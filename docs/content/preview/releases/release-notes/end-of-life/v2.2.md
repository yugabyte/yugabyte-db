Included here are the release notes for all releases in the v2.2 release series.

{{< note title="New release versioning" >}}

Starting with v2.2.0, Yugabyte follows a [new release versioning convention](../../../versioning/). Stable release series are denoted by `MAJOR.EVEN`, introduce new features and changes added since the previous stable release series, and are supported for production deployments. Patch releases, denoted by `MAJOR.EVEN.PATCH`, include bug fixes and revisions that do not break backwards compatibility.

{{< /note >}}

{{< note title="Upgrading from 1.3" >}}

Prior to v2.0, YSQL was still in beta. Upon release of v2.0, a backward-incompatible file format change was made for YSQL. For existing clusters running pre-2.0 release with YSQL enabled, you cannot upgrade to v2.0 or later. Instead, export your data from existing clusters and then import the data into a new cluster (v2.0 or later).

## Notable features and enhancements

Here is an overview of all notable features and enhancements added to the v2.2 release series. For features added in specific releases, see [Release notes](#release-notes) below.

### YSQL

#### Transactional distributed backups

YugabyteDB now supports [distributed backup and restore of YSQL databases](../../../../manage/backup-restore/snapshot-ysql/), including backup of all tables in a database. [#1139](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/1139) and [#3849](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/3849)

#### Online index backfills

* YugabyteDB can now build indexes on non-empty tables while online, without failing other concurrent writes. When you add a new index to a table that is already populated with data, you can now use the YSQL [`CREATE INDEX`](../../../../api/ysql/the-sql-language/statements/ddl_create_index/#semantics) statement to enable building these indexes in an online manner, without requiring downtime. For details how online backfill of indexes works, see the [Online Index Backfill](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/blob/master/architecture/design/online-index-backfill.md) design document.
* Backfilling an index while online is disable by default. To enable online index backfilling, set the `yb-tserver` [`--ysql_disable_index_backfill`](../../../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#ysql-disable-index-backfill) flag to `false` when starting YB-TServers. Note: Do not use this flag in a production cluster yet. For details on how this works, see [Online Index Backfill](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/blob/master/architecture/design/online-index-backfill.md)

#### Colocated tables

Database-level colocation for YSQL, which started as a beta feature in the 2.1 release, is **now generally available** in the 2.2 release. Traditional RDBMS modeling of parent-child relationships as foreign key constraints can lead to high-latency `JOIN` queries in a geo-distributed SQL database. This is because the tablets (or shards) containing the child rows might be hosted in nodes, availability zones, and regions different from the tablets containing the parent rows. By using [colocated tables](../../../../architecture/docdb-sharding/colocated-tables), you can let a single tablet be shared across all tables. Colocation can also be at the overall database level, where all tables of a single database are located in the same tablet and managed by the same Raft group. Note that tables that you do not want to reside in the overall database's tablet because of the expectation of large data volume can override the feature at table creation time and hence get independent tablets for themselves.

{{< note title="Note" >}}
Colocated tables are not currently recommended for production, as backup-restore is not yet fully supported for colocated tables.

Backup-restore support for colocated tables is in active development. Refer to issues [7378](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/7378) and [10100](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/10100) for details.
{{< /note>}}

What happens when the "colocation" tablet containing all the tables of a database becomes too large and starts impacting performance? Check out [automatic tablet splitting [BETA]](#automatic-tablet-splitting-beta).

#### Deferred constraints on foreign keys

Foreign keys in YSQL now support the [DEFERRABLE INITIALLY IMMEDIATE](../../../../api/ysql/the-sql-language/statements/ddl_create_table/#foreign-key) and [DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED](../../../../api/ysql/the-sql-language/statements/ddl_create_table/#foreign-key) clauses. Work on deferring additional constraints, including those for primary keys, is in progress.

Application developers often declare constraints that their data must obey, leaving it to relational databases to enforce the rules. The end result is simpler application logic, lower error probability, and higher developer productivity. Automatic constraint enforcement is a powerful feature that should be leveraged whenever possible. There are times, however, when you need to temporarily defer enforcement. An example is during the data load of a relational schema where there are cyclic foreign key dependencies. Data migration tools usually defer the enforcement of foreign key dependencies to the end of a transaction by which data for all foreign keys would ideally be present.  This should also allow YSQL to power Django apps.

#### yugabyted for single-node clusters

The `yugabyted` server is now out of beta for single-node deployments. New users can start using YugabyteDB without needing to understand the underlying architectures acts as a parent server, reducing the need to understand data management by YB-TServers and metadata management by YB-Masters.

See it in action by following the updated [Quick start](../../../../quick-start/). For details, see [`yugabyted`](../../../../reference/configuration/yugabyted/) in the Reference section.

#### Automatic tablet splitting [BETA]

* YugabyteDB now supports automatic tablet splitting, resharding your data by changing the number of tablets at runtime. For details, see [Tablet splitting](../../../../architecture/docdb-sharding/tablet-splitting) and [Automatic Resharding of Data with Tablet Splitting](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/blob/master/architecture/design/docdb-automatic-tablet-splitting.md). [#1004](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/1004), [#1461](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/1461), and [#1462](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/1462)
* To enable automatic tablet splitting, use the new `yb-master` [`--tablet_split_size_threshold_bytes`](../../../../reference/configuration/yb-master/#tablet-split-size-threshold-bytes) flag to specify the size when tablets should split.

#### TPC-C benchmarking

New results are now available for benchmarking the performance of the YSQL API using the TPC-C suite. For the new TPC-C results and details on performing your own benchmark tests to evaluate YugabyteDB, see [TPC-C](../../../../benchmark/tpcc-ysql/).

### YCQL

#### Transactional distributed backups

YugabyteDB supports [distributed backup and restore of YCQL databases and tables](../../../../manage/backup-restore/snapshot-ysql/). [#1139](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/1139) and [#3849](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/3849)

#### Online index backfills

* YugabyteDB can now build indexes on non-empty tables while online, without failing other concurrent writes. When you add a new index to a table that is already populated with data, you can now use the YCQL [CREATE INDEX](../../../../api/ycql/ddl_create_index/#synopsis) statement to enable building these indexes in an online manner, without requiring downtime. For details how online backfill of indexes works, see the [Online Index Backfill](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/blob/master/architecture/design/online-index-backfill.md) design document.
* In YCQL, backfilling an index while online is enabled by default. To disable, set the `yb-tserver` [`--ycql_disable_index_backfill`](../../../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#ycql-disable-index-backfill) flag to `false` when starting YB-TServers. For details on how online index backfill works, see [Online Index Backfill](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/blob/master/architecture/design/online-index-backfill.md). [#2301](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/2301) and [#4708](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/4708)

#### Online schema changes for YCQL [BETA]

Most applications have a need to frequently evolve the database schema, while simultaneously ensuring zero downtime during those schema change operations. Therefore, there is a need for schema migrations (which involve DDL operations) to be safely run in a concurrent and online manner alongside foreground client operations. In case of a failure, the schema change should be rolled back and not leave the database in a partially modified state. With the 2.2 release, not only the overall DocDB framework for supporting such schema changes in an online and safe manner has been introduced but also this feature is now available in beta in the context of YCQL using the [`ALTER TABLE`](../../../../api/ycql/ddl_alter_table/) statement.

#### Automatic tablet splitting [BETA]

* YugabyteDB now supports automatic tablet splitting at runtime by changing the number of tablets based on size thresholds. For details, see [Tablet splitting](../../../../architecture/docdb-sharding/tablet-splitting) and [Automatic Resharding of Data with Tablet Splitting](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/blob/master/architecture/design/docdb-automatic-tablet-splitting.md). [#1004](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/1004), [#1461](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/1461), and [#1462](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/1462)
* To enable automatic tablet splitting, use the new `yb-master` [`--tablet_split_size_threshold_bytes`](../../../../reference/configuration/yb-master/#tablet-split-size-threshold-bytes) flag to specify the size when tablets should split.

* Fix crash for nested `SELECT` statements that involve null pushdown on system tables. [#4685](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/4685)
* Fix wrong sorting order in presplit tables. [#4651](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/4651)
* To help track down unoptimized (or "slow") queries, use the new `yb-tserver` [`--ysql_log_min_duration_statement`](../../../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#ysql-log-min-duration-statement). [#4817](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/4817)
* Enhance the [`yb-admin list_tables`](../../../../admin/yb-admin/#list-tables) command with optional flags for listing tables with database type (`include_db_type`), table ID (`include_table_id`), and table type (`include_table_type`). This command replaces the deprecated `yb-admin list_tables_with_db_types` command. [#4546](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/4546)

* [DocDB] Allow multiple indexes to backfill or delete simultaneously. [#2784](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/2784)
* [DocDB] Transition to new leader gracefully during a leader stepdown. When a leader stepdown happens with no new leader candidate specified in the stepdown request, the peer simply steps down leaving the group with no leader until regular heartbeat timeouts are triggered. This change makes it so that the leader attempts to transition to the most up-to-date peer, if possible. [#4298](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/4298)
* Update [`yb-admin list_snapshots`](../../../../admin/yb-admin/#list-snapshots) command to use `not_show_restored` option to exclude fully RESTORED entries. [#4351](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/4351)

* [DocDB] Allow specifying IPv6 addresses in bind addresses. [#3644](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/3644)
* [DocDB] Fix TS Heartbeater can get stuck if master network connectivity breaks. [#4838](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/4838)
* [DocDB] Improve protection against hitting hard memory limit when follower tablet peers are lagging behind leaders on a node. (for example, node downtime because of yb-tserver restart). [#2563](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/2563)
* `yugabyted` `--bind_ip` flag renamed to `--listen`. [#4960](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/4960)
