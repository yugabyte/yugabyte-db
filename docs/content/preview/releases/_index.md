## Recommended release series for projects

Yugabyte recommends that customers use a stable release (STS or LTS) for production.

In exceptional cases, if new feature(s) are critical for a project, and if a customer confirms with Yugabyte that such feature(s) are actually included in an upcoming stable release that aligns to the project's production timeline, then the customer can use a preview release.

For example, if your production go-live is more than three months from now, you may consider starting your development and testing with the current preview release series. By the time your production is ready to go live, the newly-released and most current stable release series (which is based on the preview release series you used for development and testing) should be available. By following this guideline, you can enable your application to be developed with the latest available features and enhancements, while maximizing quality and stability.
