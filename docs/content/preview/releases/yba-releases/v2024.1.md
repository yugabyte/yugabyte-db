### Highlights

**Enhanced Postgres Compatibility Mode** {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

We're pleased to announce the early access of the new Enhanced Postgres Compatibility Mode in the 2024.1.0.0 release. This mode enables you to take advantage of many new improvements in both PostgreSQL compatibility and performance parity, making it even easier to lift and shift your applications from PostgreSQL to YugabyteDB. When this mode is turned on, YugabyteDB uses the [Read-Committed](/stable/architecture/transactions/read-committed/) isolation mode, the [Wait-on-Conflict](/stable/architecture/transactions/concurrency-control/#wait-on-conflict) concurrency mode for predictable P99 latencies, and the new Cost Based Optimizer {{<tags/feature/ea>}} that takes advantage of the distributed storage layer architecture and includes query pushdowns, LSM indexes, and [batched nested loop joins](/stable/architecture/query-layer/join-strategies/#batched-nested-loop-join-bnl) to offer PostgreSQL-like performance.

You can enable the compatibility mode by setting the following flags on a universe:

```sh
yb_enable_read_committed_isolation=true
ysql_enable_read_request_caching=true
"ysql_pg_conf_csv": "yb_enable_base_scans_cost_model=true,"

**New Yugabyte Kubernetes Operator** {{<tags/feature/tp>}}

The new [Yugabyte Kubernetes Operator](/stable/yugabyte-platform/anywhere-automation/yb-kubernetes-operator/) is a powerful tool designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of YugabyteDB clusters in Kubernetes environments. It streamlines database operations, reducing manual effort for developers and operators.

**YugabyteDB Anywhere (YBA) CLI** {{<tags/feature/tp>}}

[YBA CLI](/stable/yugabyte-platform/anywhere-automation/anywhere-cli/) is a brand-new open-source tool written in GoLang that's used to interact with YBA using shell commands. With minimal configuration, you can start running commands from the command line, providing functionality equivalent to that offered by the browser-based YBA interface and YBA REST APIs.

### New features

* [Kubernetes Resource Specification](/stable/yugabyte-platform/create-deployments/create-universe-multi-zone-kubernetes/#instance-configuration). You can configure CPU and memory needs for YB-TServer and YB-Master pods natively, instead of using the instance types API. {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

* [Replace node](/stable/yugabyte-platform/manage-deployments/remove-nodes/#replace-a-live-or-unreachable-node). With this new node action, you can directly replace a database node in a universe with a new one to handle problematic nodes.

* [Rollback after database upgrade](/stable/yugabyte-platform/manage-deployments/upgrade-software-install/#roll-back-an-upgrade). Ability to roll back an upgrade to the pre-upgrade release. (The release from which the database was upgraded). You can roll back a database upgrade _only_ to the pre-upgrade release.

* [Database registration simplification](/stable/yugabyte-platform/manage-deployments/ybdb-releases/). Simplification of process for registering database versions (and their binaries) with YBA. The UX has been dramatically simplified. {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

* Force update of EIT certs. If EIT certs expire, customers can now "force update" the replacement of certs with new ones, removing the need to call Technical Support. {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

* [Support for OIDC groups in YugabyteDB Anywhere](/stable/yugabyte-platform/administer-yugabyte-platform/oidc-authentication/#use-oidc-groups-with-yugabytedb-anywhere-roles). In support of role-based access control (RBAC), ability to assign YugabyteDB Anywhere roles to groups from an OIDC-based Identity Provider. {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

* [Decoupling](../../yba-releases/#compatibility-with-yugabytedb). YBA can now be upgraded to a version without requiring its database universe(s) to be upgraded. Versioning is now independent. This is enabled by features including, a published compatibility matrix and database registration simplification.

* [YBA HA enhancements](/stable/yugabyte-platform/administer-yugabyte-platform/high-availability/). Simplified user experience for active/passive YBA deployments.
