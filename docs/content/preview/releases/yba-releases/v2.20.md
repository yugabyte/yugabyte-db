{{< warning title="Technical Advisories" >}}

<br>**Index update can be wrongly applied**

Impacts: v2.20.0.0 to 2.20.1.2

The impacted releases contain an issue where an index update can be wrongly applied, leading to index corruption in the following rare cases:

* Update to a table with non-unique indexes and self-referential triggers where both the index updates, and the trigger application affect the same rows.
* Multi-row update to a table with a non-unique partial index.

For more information, see [#20648](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/20648).

If you're using a v2.20 series release prior to v2.20.1.3, it is recommended that you upgrade to YugabyteDB 2.20.1.3 or later.

**Correctness issue for queries using SELECT DISTINCT**

Impacts: v2.20.1.0 to 2.20.1.3

The impacted releases contain a correctness issue for queries using SELECT DISTINCT clause. The queries may return incorrect results when the following conditions are true:

* `BatchNestedLoopJoin` is enabled.
* `JOIN` clause is present in the query.
* `DISTINCT` clause is present in the query.
* Table has range indexes.

For more information, see [#20827](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/issues/20827).

### New features

* **New automatic on-premises provisioning**

    We've automated and simplified the previously manual or otherwise cumbersome process for preparing nodes for use in on-premises providers. System admins now download and run a single, simplified provisioning script directly on the VMs. The script not only provisions the node but also creates the on-premises infrastructure provider and adds the node to the infrastructure provider's free pool. After the process is completed, your nodes are ready for deployment in universes. With this new provisioning method, dozens of steps are reduced to just a few, the provisioning process won't change from release to release, and security concerns about providing SSH and/or sudo access to VMs are eliminated. For more information, refer to [Automatically provision on-premises nodes](/v2.20/yugabyte-platform/prepare/server-nodes-software/software-on-prem/).

* Ability to recover from failed operations such as universe growth, shrinkage, or modification, in the Kubernetes (K8s) environment by employing a retry mechanism, eliminating the need to contact support. Note that failures attributed to external factors, such as insufficient permissions or resources, should be addressed and resolved before initiating a retry. PLAT-11541, PLAT-8420

* Safeguard to prevent the restoring of a backup of a newer version database to an older versioned (and therefore incompatible) YBA universe. PLAT-8162

* Leverage the authentication capabilities of Google GKE's Service Account when taking backups of a Kubernetes universe to Google GCP. This streamlines the backup process, offering users the flexibility to authenticate seamlessly with Google Storage using their GKE Service Account. PLAT-10571

* Official support and certification of Ubuntu version 22 for use with YugabyteDB Anywhere and YugabyteDB.

* Minor correctness enhancement introduced when performing a complex Kubernetes operation such as universe growth, shrinkage, or modification. The task will now be marked successful only after successfully completing the operation, ensuring a more accurate status update compared to the previous behavior of marking it before completion. PLAT-10289

### Improvements

* Enables limited editing of in-use providers in the YBA UI, specifically beneficial for adding new regions, with a newly added runtime configuration to enable this feature. PLAT-10279
* Enhances user experience by persisting universe user intent changes to database only after the completion of upgrade tasks, ensuring consistency between the platform and DB state and avoiding potential failures. The change affects GFlags upgrade, k8s overrides upgrade, and configures DB APIs operations. PLAT-10289
* Boosts security by updating the YBA node agent and installer to utilize Go 1.21.3 compiler, patching multiple critical vulnerabilities. PLAT-11191
* Upgrades node_exporter from the vulnerable 1.6.1 to 1.7.0 to enhance security PLAT-11234
* Displays the count of tablet peers, including followers and leaders, in TServer on the metrics UI over time using a sum aggregation function. PLAT-11258
* Updates Memtable metric names and adds migration script to ensure accurate data presentation on the master and on 2.20.0. PLAT-11315
* Updates Akka version in YBA to 2.6.21, allowing Sink.asPublisher to support a single subscriber, consequently streamlining data flow management and maintaining stable operations. The update offers better performance and promises more robust architecture handling within the database. PLAT-11679
* Allows addition of `HSTS` headers and other custom headers in API responses, enhancing security across portals espousing https and fulfilling customer requirements. PLAT-9109,PLAT-11546
* Enables custom HTTP headers, including HSTS and other security-related headers, in API responses for Kubernetes-based deployments, catering to specific customer needs. PLAT-9109,PLAT-11546
* Upgrades jackson-databind to version 2.15.3, addressing high security vulnerabilities, and elevates ehcache to 3.10.8, mitigating medium to critical susceptibilities. PLAT-9635

### Bug fixes

* Ensures smoother operation of the filtered_logs.sh script by adding quotes to the log filtering command, which prevents the system from splitting the search string into multiple words. PLAT-10321
* Allows volume size decreases during Full Move in YBA (that is, after a modification to a universe that results in data needing to move from one node to another.  Example: a change instance type operation with "full move" set to true) after setting `allow_volume_decrease` to `true`, enabling smoother transitions between different instance types and disk sizes without encountering edit operation issues. PLAT-10325
* Avoids a crash when an alert is generated but no default destination has been specified for the alert notification channel by displaying `No default destination configured` instead. PLAT-10340
* Removes stale Postgres socket lock files automatically during pod startup in Kubernetes, addressing issues with pod restarts after ungraceful Postgres exits and avoiding manual cleanup. PLAT-10576
* Ensures the nodes page doesn't crash (due to a missing cluster access key). In such situations, display `<private key>` instead. PLAT-10613
* Fixes erroneous duplicate region codes (for example, us-west-2) on the universe list page by ignoring replicas located in the same area as the primary clusters. PLAT-10666
* Fixes to enable proper & correct display of the Memtable metrics. PLAT-10873
* Resolves permission errors when creating `.bash_profile` for a new user on certain operating systems by explicitly setting the file ownership. PLAT-10930
* Fixes backup and restore failure issues on CentOS 7 by treating `prom_snapshot` as a variable, resolving a regression from 2.18.4 and 2.20.0 versions. PLAT-11216
* Simplifies on-prem universe creation by allowing hostnames over 20 characters.  Also, adds a Python version check to the node-agent preflight to prevent Ansible module failures. PLAT-11254
* Enhances the reliability of backup operations on Kubernetes installations by updating the yb_platform_backup script to read the version metadata JSON file from the backup tarball instead of less reliable file paths. This not only prevents backup failures due to inability to find the version metadata files but also avoids early operational exits and restore failures.  PLAT-11354
* Eliminates user interface crashes when selecting "Custom" date picker from the metrics tab after choosing timezone from User Profile, by correctly utilizing the moment-timezone library. PLAT-11358
* Eliminates null pointer exception when adding a Read Replica in an On-Prem universe with GFlag in the Primary Cluster, ensuring smooth operations. PLAT-11417
* Fixes an issue for customers adding a read-replica after upgrading from 2.17.1 to 2.18, thereby enhancing user experience in managing universes. Rectifies an issue faced during the migration process from 2.17.1-b78 to any stable version, when attacks occur while editing the primary universe or attempting to add a Read Replica (RR). The root cause is identified as a migration script (V208) incorrectly assigning SCRATCH as the storage type for Kubernetes and On-Premises universes. To rectify this, a new migration script has been introduced that sets the storage type for these universes to null initially. The storage type `SCRATCH` is now only assigned for GCP universes, preventing the task from failing. PLAT-11452
* For Kubernetes universes, improves resilience during universe node's disk size expansion by allowing persistent volume claim (PVC) expansion to proceed in spite of errors, ensuring statefulset recreation. Furthermore, detects any issues in expansion after completion. PLAT-11454
* Allows flags to be added to a Read Replica cluster for Kubernetes, fixing a regression in the UI. PLAT-11457
* After editing a Kubernetes "provider", ensures uninterrupted universe creation, and avoids errors related to autofilled local K8s configurations via a special case handling for `kubeConfig`. PLAT-11464
* During a DR or xCluster bootstrap (that is, making a full copy from primary to replica), improved error handling so that the operation can succeed in spite of a database presence check failure. PLAT-11468
* Displays accurate restore status in the `Restore History` tab, correcting the previous issue where a failed restore was incorrectly labelled as `Backup Failed`. PLAT-11489
* Eliminates the crash of the user interface when clicking the `edit EIT` (Encryption in Transit) button from the security actions dropdown, enhancing the stability of the platform. PLAT-11503
* Reduces Kubernetes backup failure rates by addressing permission issues in the /opt/yugabyte/yugaware directory, enabling more successful backups. PLAT-11481,PLAT-11517
* Adjusts affected_node_names and similar labels (`yugabyte_affected_node_names`, `yugabyte_affected_node_identifiers`, `yugabyte_affected_node_addresses` ) to use comma separation instead of space separation to align with alert notification template expectations. PLAT-11532
* Resolves a regression that prevented backup tasks from resuming and releasing universe locks after a YugabyteDB Anywhere (aka platform) restart. PLAT-11533
* Enhances backup deletion with three attempts before declaring failure, processes GCS backup deletion in batches of 100 to follow best practices, and prevents errors by stopping function if blob size is zero. PLAT-11299,PLAT-11571
* Rectifies precheck failure during on-prem node addition when NodeAgent is employed. PLAT-11641
* Resolves an issue where invalid Prometheus expressions were generated for disk usage, affecting on-prem universes with multiple mount points. This correction ensures the consistent display of disk usage metrics, thereby offering reliable data for universes that employ multiple mount roots. The previous error resulted in no data showing for specific metrics graphs, such as Data Disk Usage Percentage and Data Disks Usage. With this fix, users can now accurately monitor and understand disk space utilization across different mount points. PLAT-11813
* For K8s universes, resolves an issue that was disabling YBC in new TServers after modifying a universe (specifically, in a way that caused an AZ migration), by ensuring YBC Helm value remains true during master rolling updates. PLAT-11919
* Corrects an issue that was preventing instance type creation in YBA DB by successfully reading values from the runtime configuration with fallback to static configurations rather than just using static configurations. Also rectifies a misconfiguration, ensuring the runtime configuration is defined at the correct scope. This amendment enhances reliability in instance type management. PLAT-10496,PLAT-11950

### Highlights

* Support for OIDC token-based authentication via Azure AD. This allows YSQL database users to sign in to YugabyteDB Anywhere universes using their JSON Web Token (JWT) as their password. When configured in YugabyteDB Anywhere, users can obtain their token from their YugabyteDB Anywhere user profile, or copy it from the YugabyteDB Anywhere landing page.

* Ability to browse the full history of restores for universes. After performing a restore, navigate to the **Restore History** tab to verify restore details and view all previous restores.

* Support for backing up and restoring tablespaces. You can now restore tablespaces to a universe with a matching topology; that is, a universe that have the same zones and regions as the backed up universe.

* Online point-in-time-recovery (PITR), which allows you to perform PITR without the need to stop any workloads.

* Enhanced metrics display. Click and drag to select a time range in any chart to zoom in to display granular data points.

* Quicker rolling restarts due to enhancements that accelerate the time it takes to perform local bootstrapping of tablets.
