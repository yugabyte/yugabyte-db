## Release announcements

* [Announcing the General Availability of YugabyteDB 2.16](https://www.yugabyte.com/blog/yugabytedb-216/)

## Release notes

{{< tip title="YugabyteDB Anywhere release notes have moved" >}}
The release notes for YugabyteDB Anywhere have moved here. The [YugabyteDB v2.16 release notes](../../ybdb-releases/v2.16/) (and all other releases) are still available in their original location.
{{< /tip >}}

Included here are the release notes for all releases in the **YugabyteDB Anywhere** (YBA) v2.16 series. Content will be added as new notable features and changes are available in the patch releases of the YBA v2.16  series.

For an RSS feed of all release series to track the latest product updates, point your feed reader to the [RSS feed for releases](../../index.xml).

{{< warning title="Technical Advisory: Use database version 2.16.1.1 or later" >}}
YugabyteDB releases in the v2.16 series prior to v2.16.1.1 contain a backup issue: if a database contains a pre-split range-partitioned table whose _primary key constraint column ordering_ isn't the same as the _table's column ordering_.

If you're using a previous v2.16 database version, you won't be able to successfully perform backups until you upgrade to YugabyteDB 2.16.1.1 or later.
{{< /warning >}}

## v2.16.9.0 - January 23, 2024 {#v2.16.9.0}

**Build:** `2.16.9.0-b67`

**Third-party licenses:** [YugabyteDB](https://downloads.yugabyte.com/releases/2.16.8.0/yugabytedb-2.16.9.0-b67-third-party-licenses.html), [YugabyteDB Anywhere](https://downloads.yugabyte.com/releases/2.16.9.0/yugabytedb-anywhere-2.16.9.0-b67-third-party-licenses.html)

### New features

* Adds the `ap-south-2` region and updates AWS AMIs to version 8.8, providing more flexibility to set up DR environments. PLAT-10407

### Improvements

* Enhances log lines for backup scheduling, aiding in the debugging of schedule-related issues and helping to prevent periodic backup schedule failure alerts, especially in incremental backups cases scheduled in short time intervals. PLAT-10694
* Enables successful resizing and modification of the instance type in GCP during a smart resize operation. PLAT-6611
* Facilitates more reliable detection of disk failures by writing timestamps to files and performing sync operations, elevating the efficiency of liveness probes. PLAT-9486
* Increases security by upgrading jackson-databind to version 2.15.3, addressing a known vulnerability, and updating ehcache from 2.10.6 to 3.10.8 to remove vulnerabilities. PLAT-9635
* Enables more efficient debugging of YBM issues by logging failed JSON request bodies and task parameters based on runtime flags, while ensuring secure redaction of secret fields with asterisks. PLAT-9948,PLAT-7719,PLAT-9707
* Updates to Apache Commons libraries have increased security by addressing vulnerabilities in various packages, including commons-collections, -value, /x/net, httpclient, and -classic/core. PLAT-11657
* Advances the YBC version to 1.0.0-b38, offering the latest functionality and features. PLAT-11963
* Removes NGINX from K8s entirely, allowing for custom headers and HSTS Headers in K8s deployments while yielding enhanced HTTPS security through Play Framework and retaining support for user-provided keys and certificates. PLAT-10837,PLAT-8514,PLAT-8063,PLAT-9109,PLAT-6893

### Bug fixes

* Introduces a new argument `useTserver` in `yb_backup.py` script to eliminate failures during V2 backup creation in S3 on Kubernetes and universes with dedicated master nodes. PLAT-11260
* Addressing the backward compatibility issue, the latest update sets missing Node UUIDs across all universes, including incoming clusters in task params, avoiding task failure due to absent Node UUIDs in new releases. This facilitates smoother regional node transfer operations. PLAT-10628,PLAT-10542
