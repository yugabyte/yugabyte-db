### Highlights

We're excited to announce the [Early Access](/preview/releases/versioning/#early-access-ea) and [General Availability](/preview/releases/versioning/#general-availability-ga) of the following powerful new features in YugabyteDB Anywhere aimed at simplifying operations, enhancing functionality, and improving performance.

<!-- **Batching of rolling operations** {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

YugabyteDB Anywhere now supports applying changes to multiple nodes simultaneously (and in parallel) within each availability zone during rolling operations, such as software upgrades and flag changes. This can reduce the time required to perform rolling operations on large clusters by 2x, 3x, or more depending on the (configurable) batch size. For more information, refer to [Batched rolling restart](/stable/yugabyte-platform/manage-deployments/edit-config-flags/#batched-rolling-restart) documentation.

**Automated YB-Master failover** {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

If a node with Master process fails unexpectedly (reducing health, but not causing service downtime), YugabyteDB Anywhere now auto-heals the universe by starting a Master process on a suitable surviving node (if one exists). For more information, refer to [Automatic YB-Master failover](/stable/yugabyte-platform/manage-deployments/remove-nodes/).

**LDAP/OIDC groups to custom roles mapping** {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

We've added support for mapping LDAP and OIDC groups to YBA custom roles, enabling you to manage user access and permissions directly from your Identity Provider (IDP) in a scalable and secure way. For more information, refer to [Support for LDAP/OIDC groups and custom roles in YugabyteDB Anywhere](/stable/yugabyte-platform/administer-yugabyte-platform/oidc-authentication/#use-oidc-groups-with-yugabytedb-anywhere-roles).

**Restoring PITR-enabled backups into a different universe** {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

Previously, backups could only be restored to the moment in time when the backup was taken. Now, you can restore backups at any point in time. Like the [Instant database cloning](/stable/manage/backup-restore/instant-db-cloning/) feature, this feature provides a safety net for rapid recovery from accidental SQL or CQL human errors that cause data loss or corruption. For more information, refer to [Restore to point on time](/stable/yugabyte-platform/back-up-restore-universes/restore-universe-data/#restore-a-pitr-enabled-backup).

**Yugabyte Kubernetes Operator** {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

The [Yugabyte Kubernetes operator](/stable/yugabyte-platform/anywhere-automation/yb-kubernetes-operator/) is a powerful tool designed to automate deploying, scaling, and managing YugabyteDB clusters in Kubernetes environments. It streamlines database operations, reducing manual effort for developers and operators.

**New automatic on-premises provisioning** {{<tags/feature/ga>}}

We've automated and simplified the previously manual or otherwise cumbersome process for preparing nodes for use in on-premises providers. System admins now download and run a single, simplified provisioning script directly on the VMs. The script not only provisions the node but also creates the on-premises infrastructure provider and adds the node to the infrastructure provider's free pool. After the process is completed, your nodes are ready for deployment in universes. With this new provisioning method, dozens of steps are reduced to just a few, the provisioning process won't change from release to release, and security concerns about providing SSH and/or sudo access to VMs are eliminated.
For more information, refer to [Automatically provision on-premises nodes](/stable/yugabyte-platform/prepare/server-nodes-software/software-on-prem/). -->

### New features

* Enable online upgrades to PostgreSQL 15 to ensure access to the latest performance improvements, new extension capabilities, and compliance with organizational upgrade policies. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="358">}}

* *CipherTrust supported as a KMS* - When using Encryption at Rest (EIR), it's now possible to use Thales CipherTrust as the Key Management System (KMS). {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1227">}}

* *YBA CLI* - a new YBA command-line which enables script-based automation. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1879">}}

*Automatic provisioning of on-premise nodes* - Preparing Linux DB Nodes for use in an on-prem universe has been simplified via a node-agent-provision.sh script. Older methods are deprecated. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1803">}}

* *Support Bundle Collection Improvements* Support bundle collection is now cancelable, is parallelized for faster performance, and includes new info such as tablet layout info, YBC config info, and system logs. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1861">}}

* *Yugabyte Kubernetes Operator**
The [Yugabyte Kubernetes operator](/stable/yugabyte-platform/anywhere-automation/yb-kubernetes-operator/) is a powerful tool designed to automate deploying, scaling, and managing YugabyteDB clusters in Kubernetes environments. It streamlines database operations, reducing manual effort for developers and operators. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1448">}}

* *K8s improvements* - pause/resume and vertical scaling (specifically, changing the disk size for pods containing Master processes) is now supported. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1493">}}

* *Preemptible Backups* - In-progress backups (such as scheduled ones) can now be automatically pre-empted by other universe actions that were formerly blocked.  A preempted backup will automatically be restarted and retried after the other op completes. {{<tags/feature/ea idea="1636">}}

* *Migration to Node Agent* - users can now update Legacy universes provisioned before the existence of Node Agent to have Node Agent installed. With a lot of automation, this happens via a banner alert, and a few additional mouse clicks. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1789">}}

* [xCluster disaster recovery](/stable/yugabyte-platform/back-up-restore-universes/disaster-recovery/). A turnkey solution for business continuity and disaster recovery, allowing you to recover from an unplanned outage (failover) or to perform a planned switchover. It also includes APIs to set up xCluster replication for a entire database. {{<tags/feature/ga>}}

* [Semi-automatic xCluster replication](/stable/deploy/multi-dc/async-replication/async-replication-transactional/). Provides simplified management of YSQL transactional xCluster replication by operating at the database level instead of the table level. This reduces the need for IT admin involvement when tables are created or dropped, as xCluster management is only required for adding or removing entire databases from replication. DDL operations can now be performed by authorized users or DBAs without needing elevated privileges. {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

* [Simplified database registration](/stable/yugabyte-platform/manage-deployments/ybdb-releases/). Simplified process for registering database versions (and their binaries) with YugabyteDB Anywhere using a dramatically improved user interface.

* Force update of TLS certificates. If certificates expire, you can now "force update" the replacement of certificates with new ones, removing the need to call Technical Support.

* [Clock sync alert](/stable/yugabyte-platform/alerts-monitoring/alert/). Fire a clock sync alert if the Network Time Protocol Daemon (ntpd) is not enabled or not running on a node of a YugabyteDB universe. {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

* [Backup portability](/stable/yugabyte-platform/back-up-restore-universes/restore-universe-data/#advanced-restore-procedure). After sending backups to a cloud object store (such as S3, GCS, or Azure blob storage), you can now copy those backup sets to other cloud storage buckets and restore from them.

* Kubernetes
  * [Kubernetes resource specification](/stable/yugabyte-platform/create-deployments/create-universe-multi-zone-kubernetes/#instance-configuration). You can now configure CPU and memory needs for YB-TServer and YB-Master pods natively, instead of using the instance types API.
  * [Kubernetes service endpoint documentation](/stable/yugabyte-platform/create-deployments/create-universe-multi-zone-kubernetes/#create-common-yb-tserver-service-for-zones). Documented the workflow to create a unified service endpoint for all TServers in single namespace universes.
  * [Kubernetes readiness probe](/stable/yugabyte-platform/create-deployments/create-universe-multi-zone-kubernetes/#configure-helm-overrides). Added readiness probes for TServer and Master pods in YugabyteDB, supporting custom or default configurations. This enhances stability by ensuring YSQL/YCQL and YB-Master pods are ready before traffic is routed.
  * [Kubernetes service endpoint](/stable/yugabyte-platform/create-deployments/create-universe-multi-zone-kubernetes/#create-a-common-load-balancer-service-for-yb-masters-yb-tservers). For single-region universes in Kubernetes, added support for creating a unified service endpoint. This is in addition to the already-supported one service endpoint per availability zone (AZ). {{<tags/feature/ea>}}
  * [ARM processor support for Kubernetes universes](/stable/yugabyte-platform/create-deployments/create-universe-multi-zone-kubernetes/). Added support for running Kubernetes-based universes on ARM CPUs. {{<tags/feature/tp>}}
  * Non-disruptive flag changes for K8s. Adding and modifying selected configuration flags for YB-Master and YB-TServer pods in a Kubernetes universe can now be done without restarting the Master or T-Server processes.

* [YBA HA enhancements](/stable/yugabyte-platform/troubleshoot/universe-issues/#run-pre-checks-before-edit-and-upgrade-operations). Added validation checks to ensure split-brain correctness post failover. Specifically, after a failover to the standby YugabyteDB Anywhere instance, if the new primary YugabyteDB Anywhere detects that its state is out-of-sync with a universe it's operating on, it aborts the operation.

* [Support bundle collection improvements](/stable/yugabyte-platform/troubleshoot/universe-issues/#use-support-bundles). Support bundles now optionally include time series metrics. Also, collection is more resilient to point failures; if one data collection task fails, the collection operation ignores the failure and proceeds.

* [Connection pooling](/stable/yugabyte-platform/create-deployments/create-universe-multi-zone/#advanced-configuration). Optional server-side connection pooling enables more connections per cluster, more efficient memory usage, and faster first connection (and therefore first query) latencies. {{<tags/feature/tp>}}

* [Improved node and process metrics](/stable/yugabyte-platform/alerts-monitoring/anywhere-metrics/#per-process). Metrics are now collected about each node's processes (PG, YBC, node agent, otel agent, and so on). Metrics cover up times, activity counts, cpu/memory consumed, and more.

* [Non-root installation of YBA](/stable/yugabyte-platform/install-yugabyte-platform/install-software/installer/#non-sudo-installation). You can install YugabyteDB Anywhere as a de-privileged user; a root-privileged user is no longer required.  This reduces friction and security concerns during initial testing, setup, and proof of concepts. {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

* [Improved support for bi-directional xCluster](/stable/yugabyte-platform/manage-deployments/xcluster-replication/bidirectional-replication/#ddl-operations-in-bidirectional-replication). Bi-directional xCluster supports adding a non-empty table to the replication stream, and safeguards against the unsafe (and potentially data-overwriting) action of restarting replication. {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

* [Azure support for multiple Resource Groups (one per region)](/stable/yugabyte-platform/configure-yugabyte-platform/azure). Added support for Azure configurations with one Azure Resource Group per region (and also one network per Azure Resource Group), a configuration providing better network management and resilience. {{<tags/feature/ea>}}
