### Highlights

We're excited to announce the key features and enhancements in the 2025.1.0.0 release, designed to improve performance, usability, and management of your database environments.

**Automatic provisioning of on-premise nodes with YugabyteDB Node Provisioner (YNP)** {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1803">}}

Preparing Linux DB Nodes for use in an on-prem universe has been simplified via a `node-agent-provision.sh` script. Older methods are deprecated. For more information, refer to [Automatically provision on-premises nodes](/stable/yugabyte-platform/prepare/server-nodes-software/software-on-prem/#run-the-provisioning-script).

**YBA CLI** {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1879">}}

A new YBA Command Line Interface which enables script-based automation. For more information, refer to [YugabyteDB Anywhere CLI](/stable/yugabyte-platform/anywhere-automation/anywhere-cli/).

**Supportability: Reduced bundle size and enhanced Call Home for Support bundles** {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1861">}}

Support bundle collection is now cancelable, parallelized for faster performance, and includes new info such as tablet layout and system logs. For more information, refer to [Use support bundles](/stable/yugabyte-platform/troubleshoot/universe-issues/#use-support-bundles).

### New features

* Enable online upgrades to PostgreSQL 15 to ensure access to the latest performance improvements, new extension capabilities, and compliance with organizational upgrade policies. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="358">}}

* *CipherTrust supported as a KMS* - When using Encryption at Rest (EIR), it's now possible to use Thales CipherTrust as the Key Management System (KMS). {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1227">}}

<!-- * *YBA CLI* -  {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1879">}} -->

<!-- * *Automatic provisioning of on-premise nodes* - Preparing Linux DB Nodes for use in an on-prem universe has been simplified via a node-agent-provision.sh script. Older methods are deprecated. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1803">}} -->

* *xCluster DR improvements* - NFS-based backup/restore for the initial full copy is improved (with an optional replication delay), failure handling is improved (retry, rollback, cancel support), EIT cert rotation works without breaking xCluster repl {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1806">}}

<!-- * *Support Bundle Collection Improvements* Support bundle collection is now cancelable, is parallelized for faster performance, and includes new info such as tablet layout info, YBC config info, and system logs. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1861">}} -->

* *RBAC* Ability to restrict users to manage only a subset of universes.   Now, some DBAs to manage certain universes, while other DBAs manage other universes. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="509">}}

* *Yugabyte Kubernetes Operator**
The [Yugabyte Kubernetes operator](/stable/yugabyte-platform/anywhere-automation/yb-kubernetes-operator/) is a powerful tool designed to automate deploying, scaling, and managing YugabyteDB clusters in Kubernetes environments. It streamlines database operations, reducing manual effort for developers and operators. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1448">}}

* *K8s improvements* - pause/resume and vertical scaling (specifically, changing the disk size for pods containing Master processes) is now supported. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1493">}}

* *Preemptible Backups* - In-progress backups (such as scheduled ones) can now be automatically pre-empted by other universe actions that were formerly blocked.  A preempted backup will automatically be restarted and retried after the other op completes. {{<tags/feature/ea idea="1636">}}

* *Migration to Node Agent* - users can now update Legacy universes provisioned before the existence of Node Agent to have Node Agent installed. With a lot of automation, this happens via a banner alert, and a few additional mouse clicks. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1789">}}

* *Deprecation of cron on DB nodes* - the use of cron to start YB services on DB nodes has been deprecated.  Instead, use systemd.  YBA now flags any existing DB nodes using cron with a warning containing remediation instructions. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1805">}}

* *GCP hyperdisk support* - When creating a Universe, Google Cloud Hyperdisks (specifically, the Balanced and Extreme options) are now a supported option for disk type on Google Cloud Platform.  Note: these disk types are only available in some GCP regions. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1946">}}

* *K8s PDB set at universe granularity* - For Kubernetes, for both new and upgraded universes, pod disruption budgets are now set for the collection of T-server pods (and the collection of Master pods), rather than at the AZ level as before. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1489">}}

* *Faster software upgrades (and gFlag changes, rolling restarts, etc.)* -  Rolling operations can now be performed multiple nodes at a time (rather than one at a time), speeding up the operation by 2x, 3x, or more. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="444">}}

* *Before/After Detail for Tasks Log* - The Task History log has been augmented to show the before state and after state for each task. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1224">}}

* *Faster software upgrades (and gFlag changes, rolling restarts, etc.) (for Kubernetes)* -  K8s support for rolling operations performed multiple nodes at a time (rather than one at a time), speeding up the operation by 2x, 3x, or more. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1710">}}

* *YSQL Audit Logs* - Support for producing & exporting to a log aggregator a audit log of Postgres statements (which is often required for compliance with govt, financial, or ISO certifications).  This is based on the pgaudit extension. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1773">}}

* *K8s Operator* - Automated deployment and management of  clusters via the K8s operator pattern.  Includes support for YBDB universe as a K8s custom resource.   Backup, upgrade, scale-out, scale-in, and more are possible on this k8s custom resource. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="664">}}

* *New K8s Operator* - Automated deployment and management of  clusters via the K8s operator pattern.  Includes support for YBDB universe as a K8s custom resource.   Backup, upgrade, scale-out, scale-in, and more are possible on this k8s custom resource. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="831">}}

* *Pagination for Task list API* - the tasks_list REST API now allows paginated (i.e. batched) retrieval. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1883">}}

* *EIT support for Kubernetes CertManager with AWS's private CA issue* - When using encryption-in-transit with K8s-based universes, support has been added for aws-privateca-issuer. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="2023">}}
