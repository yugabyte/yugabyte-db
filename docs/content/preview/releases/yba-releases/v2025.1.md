### Highlights

We're excited to announce the key features and enhancements in the 2025.1.0.0 release, designed to improve performance, usability, and management of your database environments.

**Automatic provisioning of on-premise nodes with YugabyteDB Node Provisioner (YNP)** {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1803">}}

Preparing Linux DB Nodes for use in an on-prem universe has been simplified via a `node-agent-provision.sh` script. Older methods are deprecated.
For more information, refer to [Automatically provision on-premises nodes](/stable/yugabyte-platform/prepare/server-nodes-software/software-on-prem/#run-the-provisioning-script).

**YBA CLI** {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1879">}}

A new YBA Command Line Interface which enables script-based automation.
For more information, refer to [YugabyteDB Anywhere CLI](/stable/yugabyte-platform/anywhere-automation/anywhere-cli/).

**Supportability: Reduced bundle size and enhanced Call Home for Support bundles** {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1861">}}

Support bundle collection is now cancelable, parallelized for faster performance, and includes new information such as tablet layout and system logs.
For more information, refer to [Use support bundles](/stable/yugabyte-platform/troubleshoot/universe-issues/#use-support-bundles).

### New features

* Enable [online upgrades to PostgreSQL 15](/stable/yugabyte-platform/manage-deployments/ysql-major-upgrade-yba/) to ensure access to the latest performance improvements, new extension capabilities, and compliance with organizational upgrade policies. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="358">}}

* [CipherTrust supported as a KMS](/stable/yugabyte-platform/security/create-kms-config/ciphertrust-kms/) When using Encryption at Rest (EIR), it's now possible to use Thales CipherTrust as the Key Management System (KMS). {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1227">}}

* [xCluster DR improvements](/stable/yugabyte-platform/back-up-restore-universes/disaster-recovery/) NFS-based backup/restore for the initial full copy is improved (with an optional replication delay), failure handling is improved (retry, rollback, cancel support), EIT cert rotation works without breaking xCluster repl {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1806">}}

* [RBAC](/stable/yugabyte-platform/administer-yugabyte-platform/anywhere-rbac/) Ability to restrict users to manage only a subset of universes.   Now, some DBAs to manage certain universes, while other DBAs manage other universes. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="509">}}

* Kubernetes

  * [Yugabyte Kubernetes operator](/stable/yugabyte-platform/anywhere-automation/yb-kubernetes-operator/). A powerful tool designed to automate deploying, scaling, and managing YugabyteDB clusters in Kubernetes environments. It streamlines database operations, reducing manual effort for developers and operators. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1448">}}

    <!-- Other Kubernetes operator IDEA {{<tags/feature/ga idea="664">}} -->
    <!-- Other Kubernetes operator IDEA {{<tags/feature/ga idea="831">}} -->

  * Pause/resume and vertical scaling (specifically, changing the disk size for pods containing Master processes) is now supported. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1493">}}

  * K8s PDB set at universe granularity. For Kubernetes, for both new and upgraded universes, pod disruption budgets are now set for the collection of T-server pods (and the collection of Master pods), rather than at the AZ level as before. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1489">}}

  * [EIT support for Kubernetes CertManager with AWS's private CA issue](/stable/yugabyte-platform/security/enable-encryption-in-transit/add-certificate-kubernetes/) When using encryption-in-transit with K8s-based universes, support has been added for aws-privateca-issuer. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="2023">}}

* Preemptible Backups - In-progress backups (such as scheduled ones) can now be automatically pre-empted by other universe actions that were formerly blocked. A preempted backup will automatically be restarted and retried after the other operation completes. {{<tags/feature/ea idea="1636">}}

* [Migration to Node Agent](/stable/yugabyte-platform/upgrade/prepare-to-upgrade/). You can now update Legacy universes provisioned before the existence of Node Agent to have Node Agent installed. With a lot of automation, this happens via a banner alert, and a few additional mouse clicks. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1789">}}

* [Deprecation of cron on DB nodes](/stable/yugabyte-platform/upgrade/prepare-to-upgrade/). The use of cron to start YB services on DB nodes has been deprecated. Instead, use systemd. YBA now flags any existing DB nodes using cron with a warning containing remediation instructions. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1805">}}

* [GCP hyperdisk support](/stable/deploy/checklist/#disks) - When creating a Universe, Google Cloud Hyperdisks (specifically, the Balanced and Extreme options) are now a supported option for disk type on Google Cloud Platform.  Note: these disk types are only available in some GCP regions. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1946">}}

* [Batching of rolling operations](/stable/yugabyte-platform/manage-deployments/edit-config-flags/#batched-rolling-restart) YugabyteDB Anywhere now supports applying changes to multiple nodes in VMs/K8s simultaneously (and in parallel) in each availability zone during rolling operations, such as software upgrades and flag changes. This can reduce the time required to perform rolling operations on large clusters by 2x, 3x, or more depending on the (configurable) batch size. {{<tags/feature/ea idea="444">}}
<!-- {{<tags/feature/ea idea="1710">}} -->

* [Monitor universe tasks](/stable/yugabyte-platform/manage-deployments/retry-failed-task/) The Task History log has been augmented to show the before state and after state for each task. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1224">}}

* [YSQL Audit Logs](/stable/yugabyte-platform/alerts-monitoring/universe-logging). Support for producing & exporting to a log aggregator a audit log of Postgres statements (which is often required for compliance with govt, financial, or ISO certifications).  This is based on the pgaudit extension. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1773">}}

* [Pagination for Task list API](https://api-docs.yugabyte.com/docs/yugabyte-platform/6b11a331b0b14-list-tasks-paginated). The tasks_list REST API now allows paginated (i.e. batched) retrieval. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1883">}}
