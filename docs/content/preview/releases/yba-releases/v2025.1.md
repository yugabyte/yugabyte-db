### Highlights

We're excited to announce the [Early Access](/preview/releases/versioning/#early-access-ea) and [General Availability](/preview/releases/versioning/#general-availability-ga) of the following powerful new features in YugabyteDB Anywhere aimed at simplifying operations, enhancing functionality, and improving performance.

<!-- **Batching of rolling operations** {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

YugabyteDB Anywhere now supports applying changes to multiple nodes simultaneously (and in parallel) within each availability zone during rolling operations, such as software upgrades and flag changes. This can reduce the time required to perform rolling operations on large clusters by 2x, 3x, or more depending on the (configurable) batch size. For more information, refer to [Batched rolling restart](/stable/yugabyte-platform/manage-deployments/edit-config-flags/#batched-rolling-restart) documentation.

**Automated YB-Master failover** {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

If a node with Master process fails unexpectedly (reducing health, but not causing service downtime), YugabyteDB Anywhere now auto-heals the universe by starting a Master process on a suitable surviving node (if one exists). For more information, refer to [Automatic YB-Master failover](/stable/yugabyte-platform/manage-deployments/remove-nodes/).

**LDAP/OIDC groups to custom roles mapping** {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

We've added support for mapping LDAP and OIDC groups to YBA custom roles, enabling you to manage user access and permissions directly from your Identity Provider (IDP) in a scalable and secure way. For more information, refer to [Support for LDAP/OIDC groups and custom roles in YugabyteDB Anywhere](/stable/yugabyte-platform/administer-yugabyte-platform/oidc-authentication/#use-oidc-groups-with-yugabytedb-anywhere-roles).

**Restoring PITR-enabled backups into a different universe** {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

Previously, backups could only be restored to the moment in time when the backup was taken. Now, you can restore backups at any point in time. Like the [Instant database cloning](/stable/manage/backup-restore/instant-db-cloning/) feature, this feature provides a safety net for rapid recovery from accidental SQL or CQL human errors that cause data loss or corruption. For more information, refer to [Restore to point on time](/stable/yugabyte-platform/back-up-restore-universes/restore-universe-data/#restore-a-pitr-enabled-backup).

**Yugabyte Kubernetes Operator** {{<tags/feature/ea>}}

The [Yugabyte Kubernetes operator](/stable/yugabyte-platform/anywhere-automation/yb-kubernetes-operator/) is a powerful tool designed to automate deploying, scaling, and managing YugabyteDB clusters in Kubernetes environments. It streamlines database operations, reducing manual effort for developers and operators.

**New automatic on-premises provisioning** {{<tags/feature/ga>}}

We've automated and simplified the previously manual or otherwise cumbersome process for preparing nodes for use in on-premises providers. System admins now download and run a single, simplified provisioning script directly on the VMs. The script not only provisions the node but also creates the on-premises infrastructure provider and adds the node to the infrastructure provider's free pool. After the process is completed, your nodes are ready for deployment in universes. With this new provisioning method, dozens of steps are reduced to just a few, the provisioning process won't change from release to release, and security concerns about providing SSH and/or sudo access to VMs are eliminated.
For more information, refer to [Automatically provision on-premises nodes](/stable/yugabyte-platform/prepare/server-nodes-software/software-on-prem/). -->

### New features

* Enable online upgrades to PostgreSQL 15 to ensure access to the latest performance improvements, new extension capabilities, and compliance with organizational upgrade policies. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="358">}}

* *CipherTrust supported as a KMS* - When using Encryption at Rest (EIR), it's now possible to use Thales CipherTrust as the Key Management System (KMS). {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1227">}}

* *YBA CLI* - a new YBA command-line which enables script-based automation. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1879">}}

* *Automatic provisioning of on-premise nodes* - Preparing Linux DB Nodes for use in an on-prem universe has been simplified via a node-agent-provision.sh script. Older methods are deprecated. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1803">}}

* *xCluster DR improvements* - NFS-based backup/restore for the initial full copy is improved (with an optional replication delay), failure handling is improved (retry, rollback, cancel support), EIT cert rotation works without breaking xCluster repl {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1806">}}

* *Support Bundle Collection Improvements* Support bundle collection is now cancelable, is parallelized for faster performance, and includes new info such as tablet layout info, YBC config info, and system logs. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1861">}}

* *RBAC* Ability to restrict users to manage only a subset of universes.   Now, some DBAs to manage certain universes, while other DBAs manage other universes. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="509">}}

* *Yugabyte Kubernetes Operator**
The [Yugabyte Kubernetes operator](/stable/yugabyte-platform/anywhere-automation/yb-kubernetes-operator/) is a powerful tool designed to automate deploying, scaling, and managing YugabyteDB clusters in Kubernetes environments. It streamlines database operations, reducing manual effort for developers and operators. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1448">}}

* *K8s improvements* - pause/resume and vertical scaling (specifically, changing the disk size for pods containing Master processes) is now supported. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1493">}}

* *Preemptible Backups* - In-progress backups (such as scheduled ones) can now be automatically pre-empted by other universe actions that were formerly blocked.  A preempted backup will automatically be restarted and retried after the other op completes. {{<tags/feature/ea idea="1636">}}

* *Migration to Node Agent* - users can now update Legacy universes provisioned before the existence of Node Agent to have Node Agent installed. With a lot of automation, this happens via a banner alert, and a few additional mouse clicks. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1789">}}

* *Deprecation of cron on DB nodes* - the use of cron to start YB services on DB nodes has been deprecated.  Instead, use systemd.  YBA now flags any existing DB nodes using cron with a warning containing remediation instructions. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1805">}}

* *GCP hyperdisk support* - When creating a Universe, Google Cloud Hyperdisks (specifically, the Balanced and Extreme options) are now a supported option for disk type on Google Cloud Platform.  Note: these disk types are only available in some GCP regions. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1946">}}

* *K8s PDB set at universe granularity* - For Kubernetes, for both new and upgraded universes, pod disruption budgets are now set for the collection of T-server pods (and the collection of Master pods), rather than at the AZ level as before. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1489">}}

* *Faster software upgrades (and gFlag changes, rolling restarts, etc.)* -  Rolling operations can now be performed multiple nodes at a time (rather than one at a time), speeding up the operation by 2x, 3x, or more. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="444">}}

* *Before/After Detail for Tasks Log* - The Task History log has been augmented to show the before state and after state for each task. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1224">}}

* *Faster software upgrades (and gFlag changes, rolling restarts, etc.) (for Kubernetes)* -  K8s support for rolling operations performed multiple nodes at a time (rather than one at a time), speeding up the operation by 2x, 3x, or more. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1710">}}

* *YSQL Audit Logs* - Support for producing & exporting to a log aggregator a audit log of Postgres statements (which is often required for compliance with govt, financial, or ISO certifications).  This is based on the pgaudit extension. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1773">}}

* *K8s Operator* - Automated deployment and management of  clusters via the K8s operator pattern.  Includes support for YBDB universe as a K8s custom resource.   Backup, upgrade, scale-out, scale-in, and more are possible on this k8s custom resource. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="664">}}

* *New K8s Operator* - Automated deployment and management of  clusters via the K8s operator pattern.  Includes support for YBDB universe as a K8s custom resource.   Backup, upgrade, scale-out, scale-in, and more are possible on this k8s custom resource. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="831">}}

* *Pagination for Task list API* - the tasks_list REST API now allows paginated (i.e. batched) retrieval. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1883">}}

* *EIT support for Kubernetes CertManager with AWS's private CA issue* - When using encryption-in-transit with K8s-based universes, support has been added for aws-privateca-issuer. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="2023">}}
