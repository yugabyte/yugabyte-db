### Known issues

N/A

## v2.18.2.1 - August 16, 2023 {#v2.18.2.1}

**Build:** `2.18.2.1-b1`

**Third-party licenses:** [YugabyteDB](https://downloads.yugabyte.com/releases/2.18.2.1/yugabytedb-2.18.2.1-b1-third-party-licenses.html), [YugabyteDB Anywhere](https://downloads.yugabyte.com/releases/2.18.2.1/yugabytedb-anywhere-2.18.2.1-b1-third-party-licenses.html)

For instructions on downloading and installing YugabyteDB Anywhere, refer to [Install YugabyteDB Anywhere](../../../yugabyte-platform/install-yugabyte-platform/).

### Highlights

* Support for single-table restores of YCQL backups. When restoring from backups, you can specify a keyspace and select specific tables to restore, allowing more efficient backups, and flexible fine-grain restores.

* General availability of the [YugabyteDB Anywhere Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/yugabyte/yba/latest). Use Terraform to automate provisioning, lifecycle, and other workflows.

* YugabyteDB Anywhere now proxies all communication to universe nodes for database processes via a node agent. As a result, YugabyteDB Anywhere no longer requires SSH and SCP to communicate with nodes, apart from during initial provisioning or node debugging.

* Support for GCP [instance templates](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instance-templates). When deploying universes on GCP using a provider configured with a template, instances are created based on template parameters. This allows customizations such as GCP encrypted memory and disk, TPM, solo tenancy, and more.

* Support for customizing the organization name of the self-signed certificates generated by YugabyteDB Anywhere. Customize the organization name using the `yb.tlsCertificate.organizationName` [runtime configuration](../../../yugabyte-platform/administer-yugabyte-platform/manage-runtime-config/) flag.

* Support for latency histogram and P99 latency metrics. View Percentile metrics and a latency histogram for your YSQL queries from the [Slow Queries dashboard](../../../yugabyte-platform/alerts-monitoring/slow-queries-dashboard/).

* Use the new YugabyteDB Anywhere trust store to manage custom and self-signed certificates for integrations that require TLS, including LDAP, Hashicorp Vault, S3, and more. YBA uses the trust store to verify the authenticity of TLS endpoints that it connects to.

* Tech preview of support for deploying YugabyteDB Anywhere on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) 15 SP4.

## v2.18.1.0 - June 27, 2023 {#v2.18.1.0}

**Build:** `2.18.1.0-b84`

**Third-party licenses:** [YugabyteDB](https://downloads.yugabyte.com/releases/2.18.1.0/yugabytedb-2.18.1.0-b84-third-party-licenses.html), [YugabyteDB Anywhere](https://downloads.yugabyte.com/releases/2.18.1.0/yugabytedb-anywhere-2.18.1.0-b84-third-party-licenses.html)

For instructions on downloading and installing YugabyteDB Anywhere, refer to [Install YugabyteDB Anywhere](../../../yugabyte-platform/install-yugabyte-platform/).

### Highlights

* Improvements to [xCluster replication](../../../yugabyte-platform/create-deployments/async-replication-platform/), including:
  * Support for transactional atomicity (see [Transactional xCluster deployment](../../../deploy/multi-dc/async-replication-transactional/))
  * Automatic transfer of the source universe certificate when new nodes are added to the target universe
  * Ability to delete and pause replication when the source universe goes down
  * Ability to set up replication even if matching tables do not exist on the target universe
  * Improved performance and reliability when gathering replication stream statuses
  * Disallowing replication between two YugabyteDB versions that are incompatible
  * New alerts for when a YSQL table is added to a database in replication for the source but not the target universe
  * Faster bootstrapping

* Improvements to [read replicas](../../../yugabyte-platform/create-deployments/read-replicas/), including:
  * Ability to edit the number of replicas in a universe's read-replica cluster
  * Ability to override g-flags to read replica clusters. (By default, read replicas are assigned the same g-flags as the primary cluster.)
* Enhanced [LDAP support](../../../yugabyte-platform/administer-yugabyte-platform/ldap-authentication/). Account administrators can now map YugabyteDB Anywhere roles to Active Directory groups, and members of these groups will inherit role permissions automatically.
* Deploy multi-region stretched universes in Kubernetes. In particular, when universes span two or more Kubernetes clusters and use Multi-cluster Services (MCS), address challenges with cross-k8s-cluster network addressing.
* Perform single-table restores in YCQL (as long as the keyspace-level backup was made using the table-by-table backup option) in combination with incremental backups. Previously these features did not work together.
