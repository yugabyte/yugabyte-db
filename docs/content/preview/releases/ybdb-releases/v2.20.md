```

### New features

* Added support for read-only mode for DR replica, currently supported for YSQL tables.

* Tablet splitting now can be enabled on tables with CDC configured. {{<issue 18479>}}

* Transactional CDC now supports consistent snapshots, ensuring data integrity during replication to a sink. Snapshots, ordered by commit time across all tables and tablets, establish a reliable replication order. {{<issue 19682>}}

<!-- #### DocDB

* Enables a new API to filter Prometheus metric output, providing server-level aggregation for all tablet and table metrics. Users activate it with `version=v2` in the URL. The new setup introduces `server_allowlist`, `server_blocklist`, `table_allowlist`, `table_blocklist` regex filters for greater control. {{<issue 19943>}}
* Temporarily adjusts the GFlag to not set a limit on the per-tablet overhead memory tracker, enabling the use of the tablet guardrail mechanism without previous issues and allowing for a safer control over the number of tablets created. {{<issue 20667>}}

#### CDC

* Enhances CDCSDK to communicate tablet splits to clients as soon as they are detected during `GetChanges` calls, offering improved data handling via hash_key checks and facilitating modifications to tests. {{<issue 18479>}}
* Adds yb-admin CLI support for creating consistent snapshot streams with options NOEXPORT_SNAPSHOT and USE_SNAPSHOT, guarded by the TEST flag yb_enable_cdc_consistent_snapshot_streams. {{<issue 19682>}}
* Sets the CDC Consistent Snapshot feature as a preview with `USE_SNAPSHOT` as the default consistent snapshot option while creating a stream, and guards changes by the PREVIEW flag `yb_enable_cdc_consistent_snapshot_streams`. {{<issue 20367>}} -->

### Improvements

#### YSQL

* Introduces `yb_silence_advisory_locks_not_supported_error` as a temporary solution, avoiding disruption while users transition from the use of advisory locks. {{<issue 19974>}}
* Shifts from the test flag "FLAGS_TEST_enable_db_catalog_version_mode" to the {{<tags/feature/tp>}} flag "FLAGS_ysql_enable_db_catalog_version_mode", enhancing user control over concurrent DDL execution across different databases. {{<issue 12417>}}
* Issues a notice for unsafe ALTER TABLE operations, including for ADD COLUMN...DEFAULT, to indicate existing rows won't be backfilled with the default value, enhancing user awareness. Suppression possible by setting `ysql_suppress_unsafe_alter_notice` flag to true. {{<issue 19360>}}
* Added sorting capabilities to BatchNestedLoopJoin to return the rows in the same order as NestedLoopJoin. {{<issue 19589>}}
* Replaces the `ysql_max_read_restart_attempts` and `ysql_max_write_restart_attempts` flags with `yb_max_query_layer_retries`, applies limit to Read Committed isolation statement retries, and adjusts `retry_backoff_multiplier` and `retry_min_backoff` defaults. {{<issue 20359>}}
* Disallows the creation of a temporary index with a tablespace, preventing client hangs and providing a clear error message for temporary index creation with set tablespace. {{<issue 19368>}}
* Enables index tablespace modification through the `ALTER INDEX SET TABLESPACE` command and regulates column statistics using the `ALTER INDEX ALTER COLUMN SET STATISTICS` command. Also, allows the creation and alteration of materialized views with the specified tablespace. Suppress the beta feature warning by enabling `ysql_beta_feature_tablespace_alteration` flag. {{<issue 6639>}}
* Adds function to log the memory contexts of a specified backend process, enhancing memory usage monitoring and allowing users to troubleshoot memory-related issues more effectively. {{<issue 14025>}}

#### DocDB

* Allows customizing retryable request timeouts to respect client-side YCQL and YSQL timings, optimizing log replay and preventing the TServer from rejecting requests that exceed durations. Adjusts default retryable request timeout to 660 seconds and offers a configuration to eliminate server-side retention of retryable requests with `FLAGS_retryable_request_timeout_secs =0`. {{<issue 18736>}}
* Speeds up TServer Init by optimizing the handling of deleted and tombstoned tablets. It ensures faster startup by using a new flag `num_open_tablets_metadata_simultaneously`, which sets the number of threads for opening tablet metadata. This allows for parallel opening of metadata, improving response times even in cases with large numbers of tablets. Additionally, the handling of tablets marked as `Deleted` or `Tombstoned` is managed asynchronously, marking tombstoned tablets as dirty for inclusion in the next heartbeat. {{<issue 15088>}}
* Logs all instances of tablet metadata creation/updation, enabling additional insights for troubleshooting in cases of multiple meta records for the same tablet. {{<issue 20042>}}
* Adds a 10-second delay (`auto_flags_apply_delay_ms`) between AutoFlag configuration updates and their application, allowing all TServers to receive the new configuration before applying it. This change enhances configuration consistency and update safety. {{<issue 19932>}}
* Enhances thread safety by setting `Wthread-safety-reference` to check when guarded members are passed by reference and resolving all build errors resulting from this change. {{<issue 19365>}}
* Automates recovery of index tables impacted by a bug, preventing performance degradation and disk size leak, by ensuring schema.table_properties.retain_delete_markers is reset to false when index backfilling is done. {{<issue 19731>}}
* Enhances the `demote_single_auto_flag` yb-admin command by returning distinct error messages for invalid process_name, flag_name, or non-promoted flag, thereby aiding easier identification of errors. Replaces `HasSubstring` with `ASSERT_STR_CONTAINS` in the AutoFlags yb-admin test. {{<issue 20004>}}
* Introduces support for Upgrade and Downgrade of universes with xCluster links, enhancing compatibility checks for AutoFlags during these operations. Data replication between two universes is only catered if AutoFlags of the Target universe are compatible with the Source universe. The compatibility check, stored in `ProducerEntryPB`, triggers if the AutoFlag configuration changes during upgrades and rollbacks. This prevents unnecessary RPC calls if no AutoFlag configurations have changed. Also includes fixes for cds initialization bugs in `TestThreadHolder`. {{<issue 19518>}}
* Offers redesigned server level aggregation for metrics, thus introducing more metrics for enhanced debugging. Removes several unused URL parameters and makes the new output compatible with YugabyteDB Anywhere and YugabyteDB Aeon, preventing double-counting issues in charts. Drops unused JSON and Prometheus callbacks from MetricEntity for a cleaner design. {{<issue 18078>}}
* Allows a limit on the addition of new tablet replicas in a cluster to conserve CPU resources, with safeguards for downscaling. Introduces test flags for controlling memory reservation and tablet replica per core limits. {{<issue 16177>}}
* Introduces verbose logging for global and per table state transitions in the load balancer to facilitate easier debugging. {{<issue 20289>}}
* Reduces server initialization time by eliminating the accumulation of deleted tablet superblocks during startup, through a modification in the `DeleteTablet` operation. {{<issue 19840>}}
* Enables automatic recovery of index tables affected by a bug, verifying their backfilling status and correcting the `retain_delete_markers` property to enhance performance. {{<issue 20247>}}
* Includes single shard (fast-path) transactions in the pg_locks by querying single shard waiters registered with the local waiting transaction registry at the corresponding TServer, ensuring more complete transaction tracking and lock status reporting. {{<issue 18195>}}
* Creates Prometheus metrics for server hard and soft memory limits which allow detailed insight into TServer or master memory usage regardless of Google flag defaults; aids in creating dashboards charts to monitor utilization close to soft limit or TServer TCMalloc overhead. {{<issue 20578>}}
* Enables control over the batching of non-deferred indexes during backfill via a new flag, improving index management. {{<issue 20213>}}

#### yugabyted

* Corrects the CPU usage reporting in the sankey diagram by filtering nodes based on region selection on the performance page. {{<issue 19991>}}

* Repairs yugabyted-ui functionality when using custom YSQL and YCQL ports by passing values to yugabyted-ui, ensuring the correct operation of the user interface. {{<issue 20406>}}

### Bug fixes

#### YSQL

* Reduces Proc struct consumption by enabling cleanup for killed background workers, preventing webserver start-up failure after 8 attempts. {{<issue 20154>}}
* Frees up large volumes of unused memory from the webserver after processing queries, enhancing periodic workloads by reallocating held memory to the OS more effectively. {{<issue 20040>}}
* Introduces two new boolean flags for YSQL webserver debugging and failure identification.The first will log every endpoint access and its list of arguments before running the path handler. The second will print basic tcmalloc stats after the path handler and garbage collection have run. {{<issue 20157>}}
* Rectifies an issue causing segmentation faults when the postmaster acquires already owned LWLock, enhancing stability during process cleanup. Uses KilledProcToCleanup instead of MyProc if acquiring locks under the postmaster. {{<issue 20166>}}
* Introduces two new boolean flags for YSQL webserver debugging and failure identification.The first will log every endpoint access and its list of arguments before running the path handler. The second will print basic tcmalloc stats after the path handler and garbage collection have run. {{<issue 20157>}}
* Restarts postmaster in critical sections.This applies to backend PG code; defines and improves handling of errors in these sections. {{<issue 20255>}}
* Introduces the `pg_stat_statements.yb_qtext_size_limit` flag to control the maximum file size read into memory, preventing system crashes due to oversized or corrupt qtext files. {{<issue 20211>}}
* Caps the number of attempts to read inconsistent backend entries to 1000 for safer operation and better visibility, limiting potential infinite loops in /rpcz calls and logging every hundredth attempt. {{<issue 20274>}}
* Resolves segmentation faults in the webserver SIGHUP handler during cleanup. {{<issue 20309>}}
* Display consistent wait-start times in `pg_locks`  view for waiting transactions. {{<issue 18603>}},{{<issue 20120>}}
* Reduces excessive memory consumption during secondary index scans. {{<issue 20275>}}
* Allows the finalize_plan function to now apply finalize_primnode on PushdownExprs, ensuring Parameter nodes in subplans transfer values accurately, especially in Parallel Queries. {{<issue 19694>}}
* Return correct results when Batch Nested Loop join is used for queries involving Nested LEFT JOINs on LATERAL views. {{<issue 19642>}},{{<issue 19946>}}
* Upgrades "Unknown session" error to FATAL permitting drivers to instantly terminate stale connections, minimizing manual user intervention. {{<issue 16445>}}
* Rectifies correctness issues when BatchNestedLoop join is used and the join condition contained a mix of equality and non-equality filters. {{<issue 20531>}}
* Mitigates incorrect data entry into the default partition by incrementing the schema version when creating a new partition, enhancing data consistency across all connections. {{<issue 17942>}}

* Rectifies correctness issue when queries involving outer joins and aggregate use BNL. {{<issue 20660>}}
* Corrects the Batch Nested Loop's optimization logic for proper handling of cases where the given limit matches the outer table's exact size, ensuring accurate query results. {{<issue 20707>}}
* Prevents "Not enough live tablet servers to create table" error during ALTER TABLE SET TABLESPACE by correctly supplying the placement_uuid, even when creating a table in the same tablespace. {{<issue 14984>}}
* Addresses a bug that caused backup failure due to the absence of `yb_catalog_version`, by ensuring the function's existence post-normal migration. {{<issue 18507>}}
* Corrects an error in the aggregate scans' pushdown eligibility criteria to prevent wrong results from being returned when PG recheck is not expected, but YB preliminary check is required to filter additional rows. {{<issue 20709>}}
* Ensures the Linux `PDEATH_SIG` mechanism signals child processes of their parent process's exit, by correctly configuring all PG backends immediately after their fork from the postmaster process. {{<issue 20396>}}
* Fixes a MISMATCHED_SCHEMA error when upgrading from version 2.16 to 2.21 by introducing a 2-second delay for catalog version propagation when a breaking DDL statement is detected. {{<issue 20842>}}
* Return correct result for join queries using BatchNestedLoop  join and DISTINCT scan using the range Index during inner table scan. {{<issue 20827>}}
* Renders a fix for memory corruption issue that caused failure in creating a valid execution plan for `SELECT DISTINCT` queries. Enables successful execution of queries without errors and prevents server connection closures by disabling `distinct pushdown`. This fix improves the stability and effectiveness of SELECT DISTINCT queries. {{<issue 20893>}}
* Eliminates unnecessary computation of range bounds in Index-Only Scan precheck condition, preventing crashes for certain queries. {{<issue 21004>}}

#### DocDB

* Resolves potential `WriteQuery` leak issue in CQL workloads, ensuring proper execution and destruction of queries, while preventing possible tablet shutdown blockages during conflict resolution failure. {{<issue 19919>}}
* Mitigates the issue of uneven tablet partitions and multiple pollers writing to the same consumer tablet by only applying intents on the consumer that match the producer tablet's key range. If some keys/values are filtered out from a batch, it will not delete the consumer's intents, as they may be needed by subsequent applications. Also guarantees idempotency, even if some apply records stutter and fetch older changes. {{<issue 19728>}}
* Reduces chances of transaction conflicts upon promotion by delaying the sending of UpdateTransactionStatusLocation RPCs until after the first PROMOTED heartbeat response is received, enhancing transaction consistency and accuracy. {{<issue 17319>}}
* Sets `kMinAutoFlagsConfigVersion` to 1 to resolve flag configuration mismatch issue. {{<issue 19985>}}
* Unblocks single shard waiters once a blocking subtransaction rolls back, by applying identical conflict check logic for both distributed transactions and single shard transactions. {{<issue 20113>}}
* Eliminates a race condition that can occur when simultaneous calls to `SendAbortToOldStatusTabletIfNeeded` try to send the abort RPC, thus preventing avoidable FATALs for failed geo promotions. {{<issue 17113>}}
* Fixes behavior of Tcmalloc sampling; deprecates the enable_process_lifetime_heap_sampling flag in favor of directly setting profiler_sample_freq_bytes for controlling tcmalloc sampling, enhancing control over sampling process. {{<issue 20236>}}
* Resolves instances of the leaderless tablet endpoint incorrectly reporting a tablet as leaderless post-leader change, by tweaking the detection logic to depend on the last occurrence of a valid leader, ensuring more accurate tablet reporting. {{<issue 20124>}}
* Allows early termination of ReadCommitted transactions with a `kConflict` error, enhancing overall system throughput by eliminating unnecessary blockages without waiting for the next RPC restart. {{<issue 20329>}}
* Fixes FATAL errors occurring during tablet participant shutdown due to in-progress RPCs by ensuring rpcs_.Shutdown is invoked after all status resolvers have been shut down. {{<issue 19823>}}
* Modifies SysCatalog tablet's retryable request retention duration to consider both YQL and YSQL client timeouts, reducing the likelihood of `request is too old` errors during YSQL DDLs. {{<issue 20330>}}
* Handles backfill responses gracefully even when they overlap across multiple operations, reducing risks of crashes and errors due to network delays or slow masters. {{<issue 20510>}}
* Reintroduces bloom filters use during multi-row insert, improving conflict resolution and rectifying missing conflict issues, while also addressing GH 20648 problem. {{<issue 20398>}},{{<issue 20648>}}
* Fixes handling of duplicate placement blocks in under-replication endpoint for better compatibility and correct replica counting, preventing misrepresentation of under-replicated tablespaces. {{<issue 20657>}}
* Logs the first failure during setup replication instead of the last error, facilitating better error diagnosis. {{<issue 20689>}}
* Implements a retry mechanism to acquire the shared in-memory locks during waiter resumption. Rather than failing after a single attempt, it now schedules retrying until the request's deadline, reducing request failures due to heavy contention. {{<issue 20651>}},{{<issue 19032>}},{{<issue 19859>}}
* Reduces log warnings in normal situations by downgrading repeated waiter resumption alerts to VLOG(1), benefiting from the direct signaling of transaction resolution. {{<issue 19573>}}
* Disables the packed row feature for colocated tables to prevent possible write failures post complications, as a workaround while investigating issue 20638. {{<issue 21047>}}
* Resolves database deletion failures by skipping replication checks for dropped tables during the database drop process, addressing errors related to missing streams. {{<issue 21070>}}
* Addresses a race condition on kv_store_.colocation_to_table reading and permits packed row features for colocated tables, tackling undefined behaviors and failed table writes. {{<issue 20638>}}
* Disables the packed row feature for colocated tables to prevent the issue 20638 that causes subsequent write failures after certain compactions. {{<issue 21047>}}
* Corrects RPATH setting for OpenLDAP libraries, preventing the system from picking up wrong versions or failing to find them at all. {{<issue 21236>}}

#### CDC

* Corrects the computation of the `cdcsdk_sent_lag` metric to prevent steep, disproportionate increases by updating the `last_sent_record_time` when a `SafePoint` record is spotted, in addition to DMLs and `READ` ops. {{<issue 15415>}}

#### Other

* Adjusts `tserver start` and `tserver stop` scripts to successfully terminate all running PG processes, irrespective of their PID digit count. {{<issue 19817>}}
* Updates the condition for HT lease reporting to ensure accurate leaderless tablet detection in RF-1 setup, preventing false alarms. {{<issue 20919>}}

* Introduces `yb_silence_advisory_locks_not_supported_error` as a temporary solution, avoiding disruption while users transition from the use of advisory locks. {{<issue 19974>}}

#### DocDB

* Enable checks for trailing zeros in SST data files to help identify potential corruption. {{<issue 19691>}}
* Includes version information in the error message when the yb process crashes due to AutoFlags being enabled on an unsupported older version, enhancing the ease of identifying the issue. {{<issue 16181>}}
* Prints long trace logs with a continuation marker when a trace is split into multiple LOG(INFO) outputs. This is for log readability. {{<issue 19532>}},{{<issue 19808>}}
* Upgrades OpenSSL to version 3.0.8, disabling Linuxbrew builds and updating glog for stack unwinding based on the backtrace function. {{<issue 19736>}}
* Expands debug information to help investigate SELECT command errors that imply faults in read path processing or provisional record writing. {{<issue 19876>}}
* Adds support for `rocksdb_max_sst_write_retries` flag: maximum allowed number of attempts to write SST file in case of detected corruption after write (by default 0 which means no retries). Implemented for both flushes and compactions. {{<issue 19730>}}
* Balances load during tablet creation across all drives, preventing bottlenecks and underutilized drives during remote-bootstrapping; uses total number of tablets assigned for tie-breaking. {{<issue 19846>}}
* Adds TServer page to display all ongoing Remote Bootstrap sessions, and shows the source of bootstrap sessions in the `Last Status` field, for improved visibility. {{<issue 19568>}}
* Enhances error reporting from XClusterPollers by storing just the error code instead of detailed status, making it safer against master and TServer restarts and reducing memory usage. {{<issue 19455>}}
* Incorporates a JoinStringsLimitCount utility for displaying only the first 20 elements in a large array, saving memory and space while logging or reporting tablet IDs. {{<issue 19527>}}

#### yugabyted

* Resolves `0.0.0.0` to `127.0.0.1` as the IP for master, TServer and yugabyted-UI when `0.0.0.0` is specified as the `advertise_address` in `yugabyted start` command. {{<issue 18580>}}
* Ensures the yugabyted UI can fetch and display `Alert` messages from different nodes by adjusting the `/alerts` endpoint in the API server to include a `node_address` parameter. {{<issue 19972>}}
* Eliminates the deprecated `use_initial_sys_catalog_snapshot` flag in yugabyted, thus reducing log warning messages. {{<issue 20056>}}

#### Other

* Better indentation of multi-line remote trace entry output, for readability. {{<issue 19758>}}
* Implements a preventative safeguard in TServer operations by adding a check that a tablet has explicitly been deleted before issuing a `DeleteTablet` command, minimizing data loss risks and enhancing reliability. This feature, enabled with `master_enable_deletion_check_for_orphaned_tablets=true`, is upgrade and downgrade safe. {{<issue 18332>}}

### Bug fixes

#### YSQL

* Allows the postprocess script in `pg_regress` to run on alternative expected files alongside `default_expectfile` and `platform_expectfile`, fixing unintended mismatches. {{<issue 19737>}}
* Prevents stuck PostgreSQL processes and ensures successful acquisition of locks in the future. This enhancement particularly aids in preventing deadlocks when creating replication slots with duplicate names. {{<issue 19509>}}
* Ensures OID uniqueness within a database in YB environment by introducing a new per-database OID allocator, avoiding risk of collisions across multiple nodes or tenants. This change is safe for upgrades and rollbacks, enabled by a new flag `ysql_enable_pg_per_database_oid_allocator`. {{<issue 16130>}}
* Prevents postmaster crashes during connection termination cleanup by using the killed process's `ProcStruct` to wait on a lock. {{<issue 18000>}}
* Fixes the distinct query iteration to distinguish between deleted and live keys; this prevents missing live rows during distinct queries on tables with dead tuples. {{<issue 19911>}}
* Fixes bug when type-checking bound tuple IN conditions involving binary columns like UUID. {{<issue 19753>}}
* Ensures PK modification does not disable Row-Level Security (RLS). {{<issue 19815>}}
* Tracks spinlock acquisition during process initialisation, and reduce the time to detect spinlock deadlock. {{<issue 18272>}},{{<issue 18265>}}
* Reverts to PG restart in rare event of process termination during initiation or cleanup; this avoids needing to determine what subset of shared memory items to clean. {{<issue 19945>}}
* Prevents unexpected crashes during plan creation when joining two varchar columns. Handles the derivation of `element_typeid` in Batched Nested Loop (BNL) queries; casts both sides to text to ensure valid equality expression. {{<issue 20003>}}
* Reduces Proc struct consumption by enabling cleanup for killed background workers, preventing webserver start-up failure after 8 attempts. {{<issue 20154>}}
* Frees up large volumes of unused memory from the webserver after processing queries, enhancing periodic workloads by reallocating held memory to the OS more effectively. {{<issue 20040>}}
* Introduces two new boolean flags for YSQL webserver debugging and failure identification.The first will log every endpoint access and its list of arguments before running the path handler. The second will print basic tcmalloc stats after the path handler and garbage collection have run. {{<issue 20157>}}
* Rectifies an issue causing segmentation faults when the postmaster acquires already owned LWLock, enhancing stability during process cleanup. Uses KilledProcToCleanup instead of MyProc if acquiring locks under the postmaster. {{<issue 20166>}}
* Improves insight into webserver memory usage `:13000/memz` and `:13000/webserver-heap-prof`, which print tcmalloc stats and display currents or peak allocations respectively. {{<issue 20157>}}
* Restarts postmaster in critical sections.This applies to backend PG code; defines and improves handling of errors in these sections. {{<issue 20255>}}
* Caps the number of attempts to read inconsistent backend entries to 1000 for safer operation and better visibility, limiting potential infinite loops in `/rpcz` calls and logging every hundredth attempt. {{<issue 20274>}}
* Resolves segmentation faults in the webserver SIGHUP handler during cleanup. {{<issue 20309>}}
* Allows the finalize_plan function to now apply finalize_primnode on PushdownExprs, ensuring Parameter nodes in subplans transfer values accurately, especially in Parallel Queries. {{<issue 19694>}}

#### DocDB

* Enables Masters to decrypt universe key registry correctly when Master turns into a leader following Remote Bootstrap. correctly when it turns into a leader. {{<issue 19513>}}
* Fixes metric retryable requests mem-tracker metric so it's aggregated at table-level {{<issue 19301>}}
* Ensure data consistency by checking if there is pending apply record, preventing the removal of large transactions that are still applying intents during bootstrap. {{<issue 19359>}}
* Prevents a write to freed memory; `RefinedStream::Connected` returns status instead of calling `context_->Destroy(status)`. {{<issue 19727>}}
* Allows serving remote bootstrap from a follower peer, i.e. initial remote log anchor request is at the follower's last logged operation id index, reducing probability of fallback to bootstrap from the leader; this could increase system efficiency under high load. {{<issue 19536>}}
* Corrects Master's tablet_overhead memory tracker to correctly display consumption, ensuring accurate reflection of data in Memory Breakdown UI page, and aligns MemTracker metric names between TServer and Master. {{<issue 19904>}}
* Resolves intermittent index creation failure for empty YCQL tables by validating the `is_running` state instead of checking the index state directly; prevents inaccurate values in old indexes and ensuring `retain_delete_markers` are correctly set to false. {{<issue 19933>}}
* Addresses a deadlock issue during tablet shutdown with wait-queues enabled by modifying the Wait-Queue shutdown path to set shutdown flags during `StartShutdown` and process callbacks during `CompleteShutdown`. {{<issue 19867>}}
* Reduces race conditions in `MasterChangeConfigTest.TestBlockRemoveServerWhenConfigHasTransitioningServer` by letting asynchronous threads operate on `ExternalMaster*` copies, not `current_masters`. {{<issue 19927>}}
* Allows only a single heap profile to run at a time, restricting concurrent profile runs to avoid misinterpretation of sampling frequency reset values. {{<issue 19841>}}
* Eliminates misleading `Transaction Metadata Missing` errors during a deadlock by replacing them with more accurate deadlock-specific messages. {{<issue 20016>}}
* Fixes behavior of Tcmalloc sampling; deprecates the `enable_process_lifetime_heap_sampling` flag in favor of directly setting `profiler_sample_freq_bytes` for controlling tcmalloc sampling, enhancing control over sampling process. {{<issue 20236>}}

#### CDC

* Corrects a deadlock during the deletion of a database with CDC streams by ensuring namespace-level CDC stream does not add the same stream per table more than once. {{<issue 19879>}}

#### yugabyted

* Adds a check for a join flag to avoid error when starting two different local RF-1 YugabyteDB instances on mac {{<issue 20018>}}

#### Other

### Highlights

* Support for OIDC token-based authentication via Azure AD. This allows YSQL database users to sign in to YugabyteDB universes using their JSON Web Token (JWT) as their password.
* Support for Transactional CDC.
* Wait-on conflict concurrency control with pg_locks. This feature is especially important to users that have workloads with many multi-tablet statements, which may have multiple sessions contending for the same locks concurrently. Wait-on conflict concurrency control helps avoid a deadlock scenario as well as ensure fairness so a session is not starved by new sessions. {{<tags/feature/ea>}}
* Catalog metadata caching to improve YSQL connection scalability and performance with faster warm up times. {{<tags/feature/ea>}}
* Support for ALTER COLUMN TYPE with on-disk changes is now {{<tags/feature/ga>}} for production deployments. This feature expands ALTER TABLE capabilities with a broader range of data type modifications, including changes to the type itself, not just size increments.
* Index backfill stability improvements. Ensure timely notification to all nodes and PostgreSQL backends before initiating index backfill to prevent missing entries during index creation. {{<tags/feature/ea>}}
