What follows are the release notes for the YugabyteDB v2.21 release series. Content will be added as new notable features and changes are available in the patch releases of the YugabyteDB v2.21 release series.

For an RSS feed of all release series, point your feed reader to the [RSS feed for releases](../../index.xml).

{{<warning title="Changes to supported operating systems">}}
YugabyteDB 2024.1.0.0 and newer releases do not support v7 Linux versions (CentOS7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Oracle Enterprise Linux 7.x), Amazon Linux 2, and Ubuntu 18. If you're currently using one of these Linux versions, upgrade to a supported OS version before installing YugabyteDB v2024.1.0. Refer to [Operating system support](../../../reference/configuration/operating-systems/) for the complete list of supported operating systems.
{{</warning>}}

{{< tip title="New defaults for memory division settings available" >}}

YugabyteDB uses [memory division flags](../../../reference/configuration/yb-master/#memory-division-flags) to specify how memory should be divided between different processes (for example, [YB-TServer](../../../architecture/yb-tserver/) versus [YB-Master](../../../architecture/yb-master/)) on a YugabyteDB node as well as within processes. The current defaults for these flags are suboptimal in many cases. In particular, they provide little memory for PostgreSQL, making them more suited for [YCQL](../../../api/ycql/)-only use cases.

If you are expecting to use any nontrivial amount of YSQL, it is strongly recommended to set [ &#8209;&#8209;use_memory_defaults_optimized_for_ysql](../../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#use-memory-defaults-optimized-for-ysql) for new v2024.1.x universes. This will change the memory division defaults to better values for [YSQL](../../../api/ysql/) usage, as well as optimize them for the node size. If you are upgrading a universe, you may want to instead review your memory division settings and adjust them if desired; see [best practices](../../../develop/best-practices-ysql/#minimize-the-number-of-tablets-you-need).

In future releases, the memory division settings will be used to determine how many tablet replicas a YB-TServer can safely support; this information will power new alerts warning you about overloading nodes with too many tablet replicas and allow blocking operations that would create too many tablet replicas.

### Highlights

**PostgreSQL Emulation mode**

We're pleased to announce the early access of the new PostgreSQL emulation mode in the 2024.1.0.0 release. This mode enables you to take advantage of many new improvements in both PostgreSQL compatibility and performance parity, thus making it even easier to lift and shift your applications from PostgreSQL to YugabyteDB. When this mode is turned on, YugabyteDB will use the [Read-Committed](../../../architecture/transactions/read-committed/) isolation mode, the [Wait-on-Conflict](../../../architecture/transactions/concurrency-control/#wait-on-conflict) concurrency mode for predictable P99 latencies, and the new Cost Based Optimizer that takes advantage of the distributed storage layer architecture and includes query pushdowns, LSM indexes, and [batched nested loop joins](../../../explore/ysql-language-features/join-strategies/#batched-nested-loop-join-bnl) to offer PostgreSQL like performance.

You can enable the emulation mode by passing the `enable_pg_parity_early_access` flag to [yugabyted](../../../reference/configuration/yugabyted/#yugabyted), when bringing up your cluster.

For example, from your YugabyteDB home directory, run the following command:

```sh
./bin/yugabyted start --enable_pg_parity_early_access
```

**Rollback after Upgrade** {{<badge/ga>}}

Rolling back to the pre-upgrade version if you're not satisfied with the upgraded version is now GA. Refer to the [Rollback phase](../../../manage/upgrade-deployment/#b-rollback-phase) for more information.

### New features

- [Leader pinning support](../../../reference/configuration/yugabyted/#data-placement). `yugabyted configure data_placement` command enables the support for specifying leader affinity for regions.

- Connection management integration. With connection management enabled, Nodes page of yugabyted UI will display the split of physical and logical connections.

- [Docker based deployments](../../../reference/configuration/yugabyted/#create-a-multi-region-cluster-in-docker). Improves the yugabyted docker user experience for RF-3 deployments and docker container/host restarts.

- DocDB Availability: Speedup local bootstrap. Faster rolling upgrades/restart by minimizing table bootstrap time.

- CoreDB- FIPS 140-2 crypto support. The FIPS provider has been upgraded to be FIPS 140-2 compliant.

- [Batched nested loop joins](../../../explore/ysql-language-features/join-strategies/#batched-nested-loop-join-bnl). A join execution strategy that is an improvement on Nested Loop joins that sends one request to the inner table per batch of outer table tuples instead of once per individual outer table tuple.

- [Tablet splitting on range sharded tables](../../../architecture/docdb-sharding/tablet-splitting/#range-sharded-tables). Optimize tablet splitting to efficiently process incoming data and maximize cross-tablet parallelism.

- [Catalog Caching](../../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#catalog-flags) Reduce master requests during PostgreSQL system catalog refresh by populating YB-TServer catalog cache.

- Shared memory. Implement shared memory for PostgreSQL to TServer communication to minimize latency and enhance query performance by reducing communication overhead. {{<badge/tp>}}

- [Index backfill](../../../explore/ysql-language-features/indexes-constraints/index-backfill/) stability improvements. Ensure timely notification to all nodes and PostgreSQL backends before initiating index backfill to prevent missing entries during index creation.

- Support for CDC with atomic DDL. In case of DDL being rolled back, the CDC will not send records with rolled back schema.

- Voyager assessment visualisation in yugabyted UI. Yugabyted UI provides a dashboard to allow the users to effectively plan the migrations based on the complexity and also be able to monitor the progress of each migration.

- [Wait-On Conflict Concurrency Control](../../../architecture/transactions/concurrency-control/#wait-on-conflict). Wait-on-conflict mode of concurrency control is applicable only for YSQL and provides the same semantics as PostgreSQL. {{<badge/ga>}}

- DocDB Availability: Hardening raft. Reduced time window for retryable requests by honoring write RPC timeouts.

- [Wait-On Conflict Concurrency Control](../../../architecture/transactions/concurrency-control/#wait-on-conflict). Cross-tablet fairness in resuming "waiters". Resume waiters in a consistent order across tablets, when a set of transactions simultaneously wait on more than one intent/lock on various tablets.

- YSQL QO: Cost-based optimizer. Added support for cost based optimizer for YSQL.

- [YSQL: DDL concurrency](../../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#ysql-enable-db-catalog-version-mode). Support for isolating DDLs per database. Specifically, a DDL in one database does not cause catalog cache refreshes or aborts transactions due to breaking change in another database. {{<badge/tp>}}

- [YSQL: DDL atomicity](../../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#ddl-atomicity-flags). Ensures that YSQL DDLs are fully atomic between YSQL and DocDB layers, that is in case of any errors, they are fully rolled back, and in case of success they are applied fully. Currently, such inconsistencies are rare but can happen. {{<badge/tp>}}

- [Tablet limits](../../../architecture/docdb-sharding/tablet-splitting/#tablet-limits). Depending on the available nodes and resources such as memory, and CPU, YugabyteDB will automatically limit the total number of tables that can be created to ensure that the system can be stable and performant.

- [Catalog Caching](../../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#ysql-yb-toast-catcache-threshold) Use TOAST compression to reduce PG catalog cache memory. Compressed catalog tuples when storing in the PG catalog cache to reduce the memory consumption.

- [YSQL: ALTER TABLE support](../../../api/ysql/the-sql-language/statements/ddl_alter_table/#add-column-if-not-exists-column-name-data-type-constraint-constraints). Adds support for the following variants of ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN:
  - with a SERIAL data type
  - with a volatile DEFAULT
  - with a PRIMARY KEY

- [YSQL: Lower latency for large scans with size-based fetching](../../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#ysql-yb-fetch-size-limit). A static size based fetch limit value to control how many rows can be returned in one request from DocDB.

- [CLI enhancements to simplify PITR](../../../reference/configuration/yugabyted/#restore). YugabyteDB users can perform all admin operations via a single CLI by adding a pass through mechanism to execute yb-admin commands through the YugabyteDB CLI.

- DocDB memory tracking enhancements. Memory tracking in DocDB to account for 90% of memory used.

- [Enhanced 'Explain Analyze' output](../../../explore/query-1-performance/explain-analyze/). Explain Analyze when used with DIST option will also show the rows read from the storage layer, which can help diagnosing the query performance.

- Upgrade OpenSSL to 3.0.8 from 1.1.1. OpenSSL 1.1.1 is out of support. This feature upgrades the YugabyteDB to FIPS complaint OpenSSL version 3.0.8.
