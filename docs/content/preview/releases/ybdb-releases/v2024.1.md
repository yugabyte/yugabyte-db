What follows are the release notes for the YugabyteDB 2024.1 release series. Content will be added as new notable features and changes are available in the patch releases of the YugabyteDB 2024.1 release series.

For an RSS feed of all release series, point your feed reader to the [RSS feed for releases](../../index.xml).

{{<warning title="Changes to supported operating systems">}}
YugabyteDB 2024.1.0.0 and newer releases do not support v7 Linux versions (CentOS7, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, Oracle Enterprise Linux 7.x), Amazon Linux 2, and Ubuntu 18. If you're currently using one of these Linux versions, upgrade to a supported OS version before installing YugabyteDB v2024.1.0. Refer to [Operating system support](/stable/reference/configuration/operating-systems/) for the complete list of supported operating systems.
{{</warning>}}

{{< tip title="New memory division settings available" >}}

YugabyteDB uses [memory division flags](/stable/reference/configuration/yb-master/#memory-division-flags) to specify how memory should be divided between different processes (for example, [YB-TServer](/stable/architecture/yb-tserver/) versus [YB-Master](/stable/architecture/yb-master/)) on a YugabyteDB node as well as within processes. Using these flags, you can better allocate memory for PostgreSQL, making it more suitable for a wider range of use cases.

For _new_ v2024.1.x universes, if you are expecting to use any nontrivial amount of [YSQL](/stable/api/ysql/), it is strongly recommended to set [ &#8209;&#8209;use_memory_defaults_optimized_for_ysql](/stable/reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#use-memory-defaults-optimized-for-ysql). This changes the memory division defaults to better values for YSQL usage, and optimizes memory for the node size.

If you are _upgrading_ a universe, you may want to instead review your memory division settings and adjust them if desired; see [best practices](/stable/develop/best-practices-ysql/#minimize-the-number-of-tablets-you-need).

In future releases, the memory division settings will be used to determine how many tablet replicas a YB-TServer can safely support; this information will power new alerts warning you about overloading nodes with too many tablet replicas and allow blocking operations that would create too many tablet replicas.

### Highlights

**Enhanced Postgres Compatibility Mode** {{<badge/ea>}}

We're pleased to announce the early access of the new Enhanced Postgres Compatibility Mode in the 2024.1.0.0 release. This mode enables you to take advantage of many new improvements in both PostgreSQL compatibility and performance parity, making it even easier to lift and shift your applications from PostgreSQL to YugabyteDB. When this mode is turned on, YugabyteDB uses the [Read-Committed](/stable/architecture/transactions/read-committed/) isolation mode, the [Wait-on-Conflict](/stable/architecture/transactions/concurrency-control/#wait-on-conflict) concurrency mode for predictable P99 latencies, and the new Cost Based Optimizer that takes advantage of the distributed storage layer architecture and includes query pushdowns, LSM indexes, and [batched nested loop joins](/stable/explore/ysql-language-features/join-strategies/#batched-nested-loop-join-bnl) to offer PostgreSQL-like performance.

You can enable the compatibility mode by passing the `enable_pg_parity_early_access` flag to [yugabyted](/stable/reference/configuration/yugabyted/#yugabyted) when bringing up your cluster.

For example, from your YugabyteDB home directory, run the following command:

```sh
./bin/yugabyted start --enable_pg_parity_early_access
```

**Rollback after Upgrade**

Rolling back to the pre-upgrade version if you're not satisfied with the upgraded version is now {{<badge/ga>}}. Refer to the [Rollback phase](/stable/manage/upgrade-deployment/#b-rollback-phase) for more information.

### New features

- Set preferred regions using [yugabyted](/stable/reference/configuration/yugabyted/). The preferred region handles all read and write requests from clients. Use the [yugabyted configure data_placement](/stable/reference/configuration/yugabyted/#data-placement) command to specify preferred regions for clusters.

- Connection management integration in yugabyted. With connection management enabled, the **Nodes** page of yugabyted UI displays the split of physical and logical connections.

- [Docker-based deployments](/stable/reference/configuration/yugabyted/#create-a-multi-region-cluster-in-docker) in yugabyted. Improves the yugabyted Docker user experience for RF-3 deployments and docker container/host restarts.

- DocDB Availability: Speedup local bootstrap. Faster rolling upgrades/restart by minimizing table bootstrap time.

- DocDB Availability: Hardening raft. Reduced time window for retryable requests by honoring write RPC timeouts.

- CoreDB-FIPS 140-2 crypto support. The FIPS provider has been upgraded to be FIPS 140-2 compliant. {{<badge/tp>}}

- [Batched nested loop joins](/stable/explore/ysql-language-features/join-strategies/#batched-nested-loop-join-bnl). A join execution strategy that is an improvement on Nested Loop joins that sends one request to the inner table per batch of outer table tuples instead of once per individual outer table tuple.

- [Tablet splitting on range sharded tables](/stable/architecture/docdb-sharding/tablet-splitting/#range-sharded-tables). Optimize tablet splitting to efficiently process incoming data and maximize cross-tablet parallelism.

- [Catalog Caching](/stable/reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#catalog-flags). Reduce master requests during PostgreSQL system catalog refresh by populating YB-TServer catalog cache. {{<badge/ea>}}

- [Catalog Caching](/stable/reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#ysql-yb-toast-catcache-threshold). Use TOAST compression to reduce PG catalog cache memory. Compressed catalog tuples when storing in the PG catalog cache to reduce the memory consumption. {{<badge/ea>}}

- Shared memory. Implement shared memory for PostgreSQL to TServer communication to minimize latency and enhance query performance by reducing communication overhead. {{<badge/tp>}}

- [Index backfill](/stable/explore/ysql-language-features/indexes-constraints/index-backfill/) stability improvements. Ensure timely notification to all nodes and PostgreSQL backends before initiating index backfill to prevent missing entries during index creation.

- Support for CDC with atomic DDL. In case of DDL being rolled back, the CDC will not send records with rolled back schema.

- [Wait-On Conflict Concurrency Control](/stable/architecture/transactions/concurrency-control/#wait-on-conflict). Wait-on-conflict mode of concurrency control is applicable only for YSQL and provides the same semantics as PostgreSQL.

- [Wait-On Conflict Concurrency Control](/stable/architecture/transactions/concurrency-control/#wait-on-conflict). Cross-tablet fairness in resuming "waiters". Resume waiters in a consistent order across tablets, when a set of transactions simultaneously wait on more than one intent/lock on various tablets.

- [YSQL QO: Cost-based optimizer](/stable/reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#yb-enable-base-scans-cost-model). Added support for cost based optimizer for YSQL. {{<badge/ea>}}

- [YSQL: DDL concurrency](/stable/reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#ysql-enable-db-catalog-version-mode). Support for isolating DDLs per database. Specifically, a DDL in one database does not cause catalog cache refreshes or aborts transactions due to breaking change in another database. {{<badge/ea>}}

- [YSQL: DDL atomicity](/stable/reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#ddl-atomicity-flags). Ensures that YSQL DDLs are fully atomic between YSQL and DocDB layers, that is in case of any errors, they are fully rolled back, and in case of success they are applied fully. Currently, such inconsistencies are rare but can happen. {{<badge/tp>}}

- [Tablet limits](/stable/architecture/docdb-sharding/tablet-splitting/#tablet-limits). Depending on the available nodes and resources such as memory and CPU, YugabyteDB can automatically limit the total number of tables that can be created to ensure that the system can be stable and performant.

- [YSQL: ALTER TABLE support](/stable/api/ysql/the-sql-language/statements/ddl_alter_table/#add-column-if-not-exists-column-name-data-type-constraint-constraints). Adds support for the following variants of ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN:
  - with a SERIAL data type
  - with a volatile DEFAULT
  - with a PRIMARY KEY

- [YSQL: Lower latency for large scans with size-based fetching](/stable/reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#ysql-yb-fetch-size-limit). A static size based fetch limit value to control how many rows can be returned in one request from DocDB. {{<badge/ea>}}

- [CLI enhancements to simplify PITR](/stable/reference/configuration/yugabyted/#restore). YugabyteDB users can perform all admin operations via a single CLI by adding a pass through mechanism to execute yb-admin commands through the YugabyteDB CLI.

- Truncate support with [PITR](/stable/manage/backup-restore/point-in-time-recovery/). The TRUNCATE command is now allowed for databases with PITR enabled.

- DocDB memory tracking enhancements. Memory tracking in DocDB to account for 90% of memory used.

- [Enhanced 'Explain Analyze' output](/stable/explore/query-1-performance/explain-analyze/). Explain Analyze when used with DIST option will also show the rows read from the storage layer, which can help diagnosing the query performance.

- Upgrade OpenSSL to 3.0.8 from 1.1.1. OpenSSL 1.1.1 is out of support. This feature upgrades the YugabyteDB to FIPS complaint OpenSSL version 3.0.8.

* Avoids multiple destruction of the same database connection, preventing system crashes due to simultaneous connection failures. {{<issue 21738>}}
* Stops fatal errors caused by the re-use of remote log anchor session during remote bootstrap from a non-leader peer. This fix ensures shared pointers are accurately tracked for `tablet_peer` objects using the `=` operator, preventing unintentional destruction of underlying objects. {{<issue 22007>}}
* Corrects a bug causing some tablet metrics to display incorrect metric_type attribute. {{<issue 21608>}}
* Enables the `skip_table_tombstone_check` for colocated tables to prevent errors. {{<issue 22115>}}
* Initializes `prev_op` to `UNKNOWN` to prevent AlmaLinux 8 fastdebug gcc11 compilation failures. {{<issue 21811>}}
* Delays `min_running_ht` initialization until after the successful completion of tablet bootstrap to prevent unexpected behaviors. {{<issue 22099>}}
* Resolves the issue of `pg_locks` query failure due to missing host node UUID in distributed transactions. {{<issue 22181>}}
* Eliminates latency spikes in conflicting workloads by preventing redundant `ProbeTransactionDeadlock` rpcs. {{<issue 22426>}}

#### CDC

* Ensures deletion of MemoryContext after each GetChanges RPC to prevent memory leaks. {{<issue 22328>}}
* Fixes a memory leakage issue in the walsender process by deep freeing the cached record batch after streaming to the client. {{<issue 21530>}}
* Adds more debug logs in the walsender to aid in investigating issues like linked data loss. {{<issue 21465>}}

* Solves an issue where CDCSDK incorrectly deduces tablets as not interesting for stream before reaching the configured time limit. {{<issue 22383>}}
* Enables support for streaming update operations via Walsender, enhancing PG compatible logical replication support. Now executes schema changes in the logical replication protocol and maintains a record of changes in each table's read_time_ht hybrid time in the PG catalog. Includes handling late ALTER TABLE responses and addressing incomplete cleanup in the case of a stream creation failure. This feature is disabled under test flag `ysql_TEST_enable_replication_slot_consumption`. {{<issue 20725>}}
* Prevents failures in decoding change events by refreshing `cached_schema_details` when executing a new `GetChanges` request if the client indicates a necessity for the schema. {{<issue 20698>}}

#### yugabyted
