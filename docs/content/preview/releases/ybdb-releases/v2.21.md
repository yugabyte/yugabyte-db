### Highlights

**Enhanced Postgres Compatibility Mode** {{<badge/tp>}}

We're pleased to announce the tech preview of the new Enhanced Postgres Compatibility Mode in the 2.21.0.0 release. This mode enables you to take advantage of many new improvements in both PostgreSQL compatibility and performance parity, making it even easier to lift and shift your applications from PostgreSQL to YugabyteDB. When this mode is turned on, YugabyteDB uses the [Read-Committed](../../../architecture/transactions/read-committed/) isolation mode, the [Wait-on-Conflict](../../../architecture/transactions/concurrency-control/#wait-on-conflict) concurrency mode for predictable P99 latencies, and the new Cost Based Optimizer that takes advantage of the distributed storage layer architecture and includes query pushdowns, LSM indexes, and [batched nested loop joins](../../../explore/ysql-language-features/join-strategies/#batched-nested-loop-join-bnl) to offer PostgreSQL-like performance.

You can enable the compatibility mode by passing the `enable_pg_parity_tech_preview` flag to [yugabyted](../../../reference/configuration/yugabyted/#yugabyted), when bringing up your cluster.

For example, from your YugabyteDB home directory, run the following command:

```sh
./bin/yugabyted start --enable_pg_parity_tech_preview
```

Note: When enabling the cost models, ensure that packed row for colocated tables is enabled by setting the `--ysql_enable_packed_row_for_colocated_table` flag to true.

**New YugabyteDB Kubernetes Operator**

A preliminary version of the completely rewritten YugabyteDB Kubernetes Operator is available in [Tech Preview](/preview/releases/versioning/#feature-maturity). The new operator automates the deployment, scaling, and management of YugabyteDB clusters in Kubernetes environments. It streamlines database operations, reducing manual effort for developers and operators.

For more information, refer to the [YugabyteDB Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-k8s-operator) GitHub project.

### New features

* [New Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-k8s-operator). Automated deployment and management of clusters via the Kubernetes operator pattern. Includes support for YugabyteDB universes as a Kubernetes custom resource. Backup, upgrade, scale-out, scale-in, and more are possible on this Kubernetes custom resource. {{<badge/tp>}}

* [YSQL: DDL concurrency](../../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#ysql-enable-db-catalog-version-mode). Support for isolating DDLs per database. Specifically, a DDL in one database does not cause catalog cache refreshes or aborts transactions due to breaking change in another database. {{<badge/tp>}}

* YSQL: DDL atomicity. Ensures that YSQL DDLs are fully atomic between YSQL and DocDB layers, that is in case of any errors, they are fully rolled back, and in case of success they are applied fully. Currently, such inconsistencies are rare but can happen. {{<badge/tp>}}

* [YSQL: Lower latency for large scans with size-based fetching](../../../reference/configuration/yb-tserver/#ysql-yb-fetch-size-limit). A static size based fetch limit value to control how many rows can be returned in one request from DocDB. {{<badge/tp>}}

* [YSQL: ALTER TABLE support](../../../api/ysql/the-sql-language/statements/ddl_alter_table/#add-column-if-not-exists-column-name-data-type-constraint-constraints). {{<badge/tp>}} Adds support for the following variants of ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN:
  * with a SERIAL data type
  * with a volatile DEFAULT
  * with a PRIMARY KEY

* yugabyted

  * [Docker-based deployments](../../../reference/configuration/yugabyted/#create-a-multi-region-cluster-in-docker). Improves the yugabyted Docker user experience for RF-3 deployments and docker container/host restarts. {{<badge/ea>}}

  * [Set preferred regions](../../../reference/configuration/yugabyted/#data-placement). The preferred region handles all read and write requests from clients. Use the `yugabyted configure data_placement` command to specify preferred regions for clusters. {{<badge/ea>}}

  * [Backup](../../../reference/configuration/yugabyted/#backup) and [restore](../../../reference/configuration/yugabyted/#restore) support in yugabyted. yugabyted now supports backup and restore of databases and keyspaces. You can also upload backups to public clouds, including AWS and GCP. {{<badge/tp>}}

* Enables Postgres' parallel query feature and implements parallel scan of YB tables in YBSeqScan, IndexScan, and IndexOnlyScan nodes, resulting in potentially faster query results. {{<issue 18095>}}
* Replaces outdated PGConn Fetch* functions with more robust versions for improved database testing, now supporting additional BasePGType and OptionalPGType elements. {{<issue 19906>}}
* Prevents creation of index with TABLESPACE on a temporary table, averting client hangups and displaying an error message: `ERROR: cannot set tablespace for temporary index` instead. {{<issue 19368>}}
* Offers more context to the wait states in tserver layer by adding Active Session History (ASH) metadata to `Perform` RPCs, providing insights for `PGPROC` and ASH collectors. Updates `yb_enable_ash` GFlag and assures upgrade/downgrade safety. {{<issue 19135>}}
* Reduces contention and potential deadlock risk during the execution of pg_stat_activity request by introducing a transaction cache at the t-server, which stores the active sessions and their transaction mapping. This allows the request to access the cache under a shared lock, alleviating the need for an exclusive lock. {{<issue 18711>}}
* Resolves the `record type not registered` error that appeared when retrieving fieldnames for batched index condition expressions in YB Batched Nested Loop through bypassing fieldname resolution for indecipherable batched expressions. {{<issue 19094>}}
* Trims unnecessary master RPC calls during connection initialization by removing `YB_YQL_PREFETCHER_NO_CACHE` enum value and introducing `YBCStartSysTablePrefetchingNoCache` function. {{<issue 19304>}}

* Resolves an issue with RowCompareExpression bindings that previously led to incorrect results and occasional crashes in `YbBindScanKeys` by accounting for unique PgGate request conditions. {{<issue 19384>}}
* Reduces unnecessary error logs related to tablespace during initdb by checking the `FLAGS_create_initial_sys_catalog_snapshot` before initiating the tablespace refresh task. {{<issue 19386>}}
* Eliminates unnecessary error logs during initdb bootstrap process by checking for the existence of `pg_yb_tablegroup` catalog only in non-bootstrap mode. {{<issue 19387>}}
* Enhances read committed isolation by enabling each statement to pick a read time on docdb when possible, ensuring more efficient operations and adding a test for this functionality. {{<issue 19397>}}
* Removes the `TransactionCache` class shifting session's transactions' information closer to the session in the `SessionInfo` structure, averting a potential deadlock scenario by ensuring smoother test execution when per-database catalog version mode is activated. {{<issue 18711>}}
* Corrects the handling of RowCompareExpression bindings in YbBindScanKeys to prevent inaccurate results and potential system crashes. {{<issue 19384>}}
* Launches the `yb_auh` extension, building the foundation for the Active Universe History project with a circular buffer for wait events storage and a background worker for local tserver and PG backends polling. New Gflags are introduced: `enable_yb_auh`, `yb_auh.circular_buffer_size`, `yb_auh.sampling_interval`, and `yb_auh.sample_size`. Default settings are disabled, 16 MB, 1000 ms, and 500, respectively. {{<issue 19127>}}
* Adds pg_hint_plan syntax and functionality to control batched nested loop joins, allows setting hints `YbBatchedNL(t1 t2)` and `NoYbBatchedNL`, and modifies `yb_prefer_bnl` handling. Also, it removes BNL's dependency on `enable_nestloop` and adjusts cost model. {{<issue 19494>}}
* Enables the modification of `is_single_row_txn` for finer control over non-transactional writes required by `COPY`, index backfill, or when `yb_disable_transactional_writes` is set, preventing issues during non-bufferable operations for single row transactions. {{<issue 4906>}}
* Introduces a new PG function `yb_active_session_history_internal` and a corresponding view `yb_active_session_history` for easier querying, which require the Gflag `TEST_yb_enable_ash` to be enabled; errors will occur otherwise. {{<issue 19128>}}
* Enables fetching of ASH samples from all PG processes, excluding prepared transactions, background workers, and backends without set ASH metadata, using a newly-created Postgres backend. {{<issue 19129>}}
* Introduces a `NOTICE` for potentially unsafe ALTER TABLE operations (such as altering primary key, altering type), ensuring users are aware of the risks. To suppress this notice, adjust the `ysql_suppress_unsafe_alter_notice` gflag to true. {{<issue 19360>}}
* Adds a new column with both a `NOT NULL` constraint and a non-volatile `DEFAULT` value without needing a table scan, leading to faster YSQL Alter Table operations. No table scan is needed as all existing rows will use the non-volatile `DEFAULT` value in their new column, reducing constraint violation checks time. {{<issue 19355>}}
* Simplifies the code in the pg_dml_read file by replacing the `DocKeyBuilder` helper class with a function and switches from using an arena array to `boost::small_vector`. {{<issue 19685>}}
* Enables an alternative table rewrite approach that only drops and recreates associated DocDB tables and indexes, using the relfilenode field to map a PostgreSQL table OID to the respective DocDB table, resulting in a more efficient way to perform operations such as ALTER TYPE and ADD/DROP primary key. {{<issue 4034>}}
* Allows ordered index scans with `IN` conditions on a lower column, ensuring accurate result order for YB LSM indexes, and generalizes the fix to all such indexes. {{<issue 19576>}}
* Enables `PgClientServiceImpl` to periodically clear its own `reserved_oids_map_`, enhancing database cleaning and eliminating reliance on `TabletServer` for scheduling. {{<issue 19916>}}
* Optimizes scans not requiring certain row order by allowing parallel scans of multiple partitions and secondary index scans, potentially altering the output row order in some queries without the ORDER BY clause. {{<issue 13737>}}
* Replaces deprecated `FetchValue` with `FetchRow`, simplifying changes and fixing indentation issues in ‘pg_mini-’ without modifying formatting in other areas. {{<issue 19918>}}
* Renames the term `Active Universe History` to `Active Session History` for enhanced comprehension. {{<issue 19948>}}
* Introduces `yb_silence_advisory_locks_not_supported_error` as a temporary solution for users to avoid disruption when using advisory locks without actual lock acquisition. {{<issue 19974>}}

* Reduces chances of transaction deadlocks and improves fairness in read committed isolation by modifying the order of transactions resumption across all tablets based on `xactStartTimestamp`. {{<issue 18055>}}
* Switches the data transfer rate on the tserver UI from MiBps to KiBps for enhanced precision, considering the typical tablet data transfer range. {{<issue 19203>}}
* Reduces tablet shutdown issues and delayed database operations by addressing a bug causing unnecessary blockage in clearing the `ResumedWaiterRunner` queue during `WaitQueue` shutdown. {{<issue 19272>}}
* Offers redesigned server level aggregation for metrics, thus introducing more metrics for enhanced debugging. Removes several unused URL parameters and makes the new output compatible with YBA and YBM, preventing double-counting issues in charts. Drops unused Json and Prometheus callbacks from MetricEntity for a cleaner design. {{<issue 18078>}}
* Replaces glog includes with yb/util, introducing yb VLOG macros for clearer differentiation between INFO and VERBOSE logs, while addressing issues of duplicate includes. {{<issue 15273>}}
* Adjusts the verbose level for VLOG macros to help differentiate between INFO and VERBOSE logs, fostering ease in debugging and analysis with better log filtration. {{<issue 15273>}}
