### Highlights

We're excited to announce the Technical Preview of two foundational features as part of this release.

**PostgreSQL 15 Support** {{<tags/feature/tp>}}

As part of this release, we have upgraded our PostgreSQL fork from version 11.2 to 15.0, enabling you to leverage the many key capabilities introduced in PostgreSQL between these two versions. This upgrade brings YSQL API support for numerous features, including stored generated columns, foreign keys on partitioned tables, and non-distinct NULLs in unique indexes. It also introduces query execution optimizations like incremental sort and memoization, along with various observability and security enhancements.  For more information, refer to [PostgreSQL 15 features](../../../develop/pg15-features/).

**Query Diagnostics** {{<tags/feature/tp>}}

This feature significantly simplifies tuning poorly performing SQL queries by allowing you to capture and export detailed diagnostic information, including bind variables and constants, pg_stat_statements statistics, schema details, active session history, and execution plans. Refer to [Query diagnostics](../../../explore/query-1-performance/query-diagnostics/).

**Active session history**

In addition, the Active Session History, which provides real-time and historical views of system activity, is now enabled by default. For more information, refer to [Active Session History](../../../explore/observability/active-session-history/).
