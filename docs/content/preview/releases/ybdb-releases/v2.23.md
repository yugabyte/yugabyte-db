```

### Highlights

We're excited to announce the [technical preview](/preview/releases/versioning/#tech-preview-tp) of four powerful new features in YugabyteDB aimed at simplifying operations, enhancing functionality, and improving performance.

**Instant database cloning** {{<tags/feature/tp>}}

[Instant database cloning](/preview/manage/backup-restore/instant-db-cloning/) allows you to quickly create independent copies of your database for data recovery, development, and testing. Clones can be created in seconds, and initially consume no additional disk space because they share the same data files as the original database. Clones can be created as of now, or as of any time in the recent past (within a configurable history retention period), so developers can experiment without impacting production performance. Clones also provide a safety net for rapid recovery from accidental data loss or corruption.

**pg_cron extension** {{<tags/feature/tp>}}

We're introducing support for the [pg_cron extension](/preview/explore/ysql-language-features/pg-extensions/extension-pgcron/), which brings a cron-based job scheduler directly into the database. With pg_cron, you can schedule YSQL commands using familiar cron syntax, including jobs on intervals as fine as seconds. While pg_cron operates on a single node known as the pg_cron leader, the queries it schedules leverage the full resources of the distributed cluster. In case of node failure, leadership is automatically transferred, ensuring continuous availability and smooth scheduling operations.

**Semi-automatic xCluster replication** {{<tags/feature/tp>}}

[Semi-automatic xCluster replication](/preview/deploy/multi-dc/async-replication/async-replication-transactional/) simplifies the management of YSQL transactional xCluster replication by operating at the database level instead of the table level. This reduces the need for IT admin involvement when tables are created or dropped, as xCluster management is only required for adding or removing entire databases from replication. DDL operations can be performed by authorized users or DBAs without needing elevated privileges. Semi-automatic xCluster supports YSQL transactional replication and is ideal for Disaster Recovery (DR) purposes.

**Improvement to backward scans** {{<tags/feature/tp>}}

We've improved the performance of backward scans by 10x. For example, descending scans on tables that are stored in ascending order are now much faster. Previously, backward scans were significantly slower than forward scans in YugabyteDB, causing the query optimizer to implement various workarounds, including adding a sort operator on top of the forward scan operator to keep the backward scan pattern comparable. Such optimizer tricks might have been ineffective in complex query plans. The improvements to backward scan performance now allows such queries to be faster out of the box. You enable the feature using the `use_fast_backward_scan` preview flag.

<!-- ### New features

* [Semi-automatic transactional xCluster setup](/preview/deploy/multi-dc/async-replication/async-replication-transactional/). Provides operationally simpler setup and management of YSQL transactional xCluster replication, as well as simpler steps for performing DDL changes. {{<tags/feature/tp>}}

* [Database clone](/preview/manage/backup-restore/lightweight-db-clone/). Support for fast Database clones from a given database as-of time. {{<tags/feature/tp>}}

* [pg_cron extension](preview/explore/ysql-language-features/pg-extensions/extension-pgcron/). Native support for pg_cron extension. {{<tags/feature/tp>}} -->
