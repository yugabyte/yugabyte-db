### Highlights

### New features

- Support for upgrading to PG15 for OSS clusters using yugabyted. {{<tags/feature/ea idea="1746">}}

- A new yugabyted UI tab is enabled to display the xcluster replication details of the source and destination universe. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1763">}}

- Enhanced the Voyager assessment UI to provide detailed information on migration complexity and breakdown of scheme recommendation. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="2184">}}

- yugabyted enables support for IPV6. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1854">}}

- Enable online upgrades to PostgreSQL 15 to ensure access to the latest performance improvements, new extension capabilities, and compliance with organizational upgrade policies. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="358">}}

- Seamlessly replicates YSQL DDL changes across xCluster setups, eliminating manual coordination and reducing replication disruptions. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="153">}}

- With sampled analyze, the time to analyze a table is no longer proportional to the size of the table. The improvement brings the time to analyze down significantly. For example, time to analyze 1 TB table came down from 35 minutes to under 3 minutes. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1790">}}

- Introduces Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) indexing in pgvector for fast and efficient high-dimensional vector search in YugabyteDB. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1111">}}

- YugabyteDB is added support for Parallel Queries for Colocated database which allows PostgreSQL to devise query plans that can leverage multiple CPUs in order to answer queries faster. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="577">}}

- This feature provides the fast path for bulk load scenarios for colocated tables in particular. Scoped under tserver gflag - ysql_colocated_fastpath_txn_copy, this can improve copy times on colocated by upto 3x on tables with multiple indexes. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1802">}}

- Enables session-based and transactional advisory locks for coordination and concurrency control in distributed environments. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="812">}}

- *Non-disruptive adding of indexes for xCluster* - Adding an index to a database configured with bi-directional xCluster Replication (or other non-transactional xCluster Repolication) is now a non-disruptive, no-downtime operation. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1536">}}

- Allows querying historical database state by specifying a past timestamp, aiding in auditing, debugging, and data analysis. {{<tags/feature/ea idea="1182">}}

- Enable online upgrades to PostgreSQL 15 to ensure access to the latest performance improvements, new extension capabilities, and compliance with organizational upgrade policies. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="358">}}

- Allows creation of the Foreign keys on partitioned tables. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="467">}}

- Combine multiple indexes for more efficient scans. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1092">}}

- By default  unique index treat NULL values as distinct entries (and not equal), allowing multiple nulls for  a column. The NULLS NOT DISTINCT allows multiple NULL values to be treated  equivalently. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="934">}}

- Execution for Queries using InsertOnConflict clause are optimized for efficient execution for YugabyteDB distributed architecture. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1455">}}

- Provides ability to find catalog tables which can be preloaded to improve  latency for first query in connection or after DDL in the cluster. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1781">}}

- Added support for cost based optimizer for YSQL. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="483">}}

- Query Plan Management (QPM) introduced to ensure stable and adaptable query performance by preventing plan regression and automatically detecting optimal new plans. {{<tags/feature/ea idea="483">}}

- Compressed catalog tuples when storing in the PG catalog cache to reduce the memory consumption. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1229">}}

- IDEA-599

- IDEA-2158

- yb_index_check() is a built-in utility that helps detect and diagnose index inconsistencies in your database to ensure reliable query results. {{<tags/feature/ea idea="2160">}}

- Support to align YSQL DDL semantics with PostgreSQL by allowing DDL statements to execute within the main transaction block instead of autonomous transaction. {{<tags/feature/tp idea="1677">}}

- CDC Logical Replication support for xCluster feature on source cluster. {{<tags/feature/ea idea="82">}}

- Get real-time and historical information about active sessions to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="830">}}

- PostgreSQL Anonymizer, which masks or replaces personally identifiable information (PII) or commercially sensitive data, is now bundled with Yugabyte. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1497">}}
