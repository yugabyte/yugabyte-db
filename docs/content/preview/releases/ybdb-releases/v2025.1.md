### Highlights

**PostgreSQL 15 compatible YugabyteDB clusters (GA)** {{<tags/feature/ga idea="358">}}

This is the first stable release featuring a PostgreSQL fork rebase from version 11.2 to 15.0, enabling you to leverage the many key capabilities introduced in PostgreSQL between these two versions. This upgrade brings YSQL API support for numerous features, including stored generated columns, foreign keys on partitioned tables, and non-distinct NULLs in unique indexes. It also introduces query execution optimizations like incremental sort and memoization, along with various observability and security enhancements.

We're also pleased to announce that YugabyteDB 2025.1.0 supports in-place online upgrades and downgrades—even with the PostgreSQL fork rebased to 15.0. Please note that the source cluster must be running version 2024.2.3.0 or later to upgrade to version 2025.1.0.

**Support pgvector extension - With Indexing support** {{<tags/feature/ea idea="1111">}}

Brings AI-native capability by supporting pgvector with indexing, enabling efficient similarity search in vector workloads. Enhances vector search capabilities by introducing Hierarchical Navigable Small World (HNSW) indexing, enabling faster and more efficient high-dimensional vector lookups.

**xCluster DDL replication** {{<tags/feature/ea idea="153">}}

With this feature, YSQL DDL changes are seamlessly replicated across xCluster setups, eliminating the need to manually apply DDLs on both source and target clusters.

**Parallel queries: Enabling PG parallelism for colocated tables** {{<tags/feature/ea idea="577">}}

Improves query performance for colocated tables by allowing PostgreSQL to leverage multiple CPUs, leading to faster query execution times.

**Optimization for INSERT ON CONFLICT batching** {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1455">}}

Queries using the `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` clause are optimized for efficient execution, with automatic batching applied when multiple statements are executed to improve performance.

**Cost-Based Optimizer (CBO) GA** {{<tags/feature/ga idea="483">}}  The CBO leverages YugabyteDB’s distributed storage architecture and advanced query execution optimizations—including query pushdowns, LSM indexes, and batched nested loop joins—to deliver PostgreSQL-like performance. See this page for instructions on enabling CBO.

**Bitmap scan support** {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1092">}} Combine multiple indexes for more efficient scans. Refer to the t-server configuration to learn how to enable bitmap-scan support.

### New features

- [PG15 for OSS clusters]. Support for upgrading to PG15 for OSS clusters using yugabyted. {{<tags/feature/ea idea="1746">}}

- [xCluster details in yugabyted UI]. A new yugabyted UI tab is enabled to display the xCluster replication details of the source and destination universe. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1763">}}

- [Voyager assessment UI enhancements]. Provides detailed information on migration complexity and breakdown of schema recommendation. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="2184">}}

- [yugabyted IP address support] yugabyted enables support for IPv6 address. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1854">}}

- [Online upgrades to PostgreSQL 15] to ensure access to the latest performance improvements, new extension capabilities, and compliance with organizational upgrade policies. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="358">}}

- [xCluster DDL replication for YSQL]. Seamlessly replicates YSQL DDL changes across xCluster setups, eliminating manual coordination and reducing replication disruptions. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="153">}}

- [Sampling schema in Analyze]. With sampled analyze, the time to analyze a table is no longer proportional to the size of the table. The improvement brings the time to analyze down significantly. For example, time to analyze 1 TB table is down from 35 minutes to under 3 minutes. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1790">}}

- [PgVector HNSW index support] for fast and efficient high-dimensional vector search in YugabyteDB. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1111">}}

- [Parallel queries] support for colocated database which allows PostgreSQL to devise query plans that can leverage multiple CPUs in order to answer queries faster. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="577">}}

- Fast path support for bulk load scenarios for colocated tables in particular. Scoped under the YB-TServer flag `ysql_colocated_fastpath_txn_copy`, this can improve copy times on colocated by upto 3x on tables with multiple indexes. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1802">}}

- [Advisory locks]. Enables session-based and transactional advisory locks for coordination and concurrency control in distributed environments. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="812">}}

- [Non-disruptive adding of indexes for xCluster] Adding an index to a database configured with bi-directional xCluster Replication (or other non-transactional xCluster Repolication) is now a non-disruptive, no-downtime operation. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1536">}}

- [PITR- flashback query].Allows querying historical database state by specifying a past timestamp, aiding in auditing, debugging, and data analysis. {{<tags/feature/ea idea="1182">}}

- [Enable online upgrades to PostgreSQL 15] to ensure access to the latest performance improvements, new extension capabilities, and compliance with organizational upgrade policies. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="358">}}

- Allows creation of the [Foreign keys] on partitioned tables. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="467">}}

- [Bitmap scan support] Combine multiple indexes for more efficient scans. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1092">}}

- By default unique index treat NULL values as distinct entries (and not equal), allowing multiple nulls for a column. The NULLS NOT DISTINCT allows multiple NULL values to be treated equivalently. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="934">}}

- Execution for Queries using InsertOnConflict clause are optimized for efficient execution for YugabyteDB distributed architecture. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1455">}}

- Catalog caching

  - Provides ability to find catalog tables which can be preloaded to improve latency for first query in connection or after DDL in the cluster. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1781">}}

  - Compressed catalog tuples when storing in the PG catalog cache to reduce the memory consumption. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1229">}}

  - On DDL execution propagate and apply the catalog cache invalidation messages to avoid invalidating and rebuilding the entire catalog cache in most cases. This should reduce the performance impact of DDLs on concurrent DML statements, particularly on DMLs unrelated to the objects affected by the DDL. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="599">}}

- Added support for Cost-based Optimizer for YSQL. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="483">}}

- Query Plan Management (QPM) introduced to ensure stable and adaptable query performance by preventing plan regression and automatically detecting optimal new plans. {{<tags/feature/ea idea="1107">}}

- [YSQL table inheritance] Adds YSQL support for table inheritance using the INHERITS keyword, which allows creating child tables that inherit columns and certain constraints from one or more parent tables. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="2158">}}

- [YSQL index consistency checker] yb_index_check() is a built-in utility that helps detect and diagnose index inconsistencies in your database to ensure reliable query results. {{<tags/feature/ea idea="2160">}}

- [Transactional DDL] Support to align YSQL DDL semantics with PostgreSQL by allowing DDL statements to execute within the main transaction block instead of autonomous transaction. {{<tags/feature/tp idea="1677">}}

- CDC Logical Replication support for xCluster feature on source cluster. {{<tags/feature/ea idea="82">}}

- [Active Session History] Get real-time and historical information about active sessions to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="830">}}

- PostgreSQL Anonymizer, which masks or replaces personally identifiable information (PII) or commercially sensitive data, is now bundled with Yugabyte. {{<tags/feature/ga idea="1497">}}
