### Improvements

#### YSQL

* Issues a notice for unsafe ALTER TABLE operations, including for `ADD COLUMN...DEFAULT`, to indicate existing rows won't be backfilled with the default value, enhancing user awareness. Suppression possible by setting `ysql_suppress_unsafe_alter_notice` gflag to true. {{<issue 19360>}}
* Added sorting capabilities to BatchNestedLoopJoin to return the rows in the same order as NestedLoopJoin {{<issue 19589>}}
* Replaces the `ysql_max_read_restart_attempts` and `ysql_max_write_restart_attempts` gflags with `yb_max_query_layer_retries`, applies limit to Read Committed isolation statement retries, and adjusts `retry_backoff_multiplier` and `retry_min_backoff` defaults. {{<issue 20359>}}

#### DocDB

* Allows tracing of UpdateConsensus API by enabling the `collect_update_consensus_traces` GFlag, providing trace logs for UpdateConsensus from remote followers while also ignoring `request.trace_requested` if both leader and follower doesn't support this change. {{<issue 19417>}}
* Allows customizing retryable request timeouts to respect client-side YCQL and YSQL timings, optimizing log replay and preventing the tserver from rejecting requests that exceed durations. Adjusts default retryable request timeout to 660 seconds and offers a configuration to eliminate server-side retention of retryable requests with `FLAGS_retryable_request_timeout_secs =0`. {{<issue 18736>}}
* Logs all instances of tablet metadata creation/updation, enabling additional insights for troubleshooting in cases of multiple meta records for the same tablet. {{<issue 20042>}}
* Automates recovery of index tables impacted by a bug, preventing performance degradation and disk size leak, by ensuring `schema.table_properties.retain_delete_markers` is reset to false when index backfilling is done. {{<issue 19731>}}
* Offers redesigned server level aggregation for metrics, thus introducing more metrics for enhanced debugging. Removes several unused URL parameters and makes the new output compatible with YBA and YBM, preventing double-counting issues in charts. Drops unused JSON and Prometheus callbacks from MetricEntity for a cleaner design. {{<issue 18078>}}
* Enhances debugging by adding verbose logging for load balancer global and per-table state changes and including global state information when printing sorted load. {{<issue 20289>}}
* Reduces server initialization time by eliminating the accumulation of deleted tablet superblocks during startup, through a modification in the `DeleteTablet` operation. {{<issue 19840>}}
* Enables automatic recovery of index tables affected by a bug, verifying their backfilling status and correcting the `retain_delete_markers` property to enhance performance. {{<issue 20247>}}
* Integrates hard and soft server memory limit metrics into Prometheus, enabling better visualization of memory allocation and usage data, specifically in non-default value universes. {{<issue 20578>}}
* Enables control over the batching of non-deferred indexes during backfill via a new flag, improving index management. {{<issue 20213>}}

### Bug fixes

#### YSQL

* Eliminates the issue where killing a background worker consumed a `Proc` struct without returning it, effectively limiting webserver restarts to eight times. {{<issue 20154>}}
* Introduces enhanced logging in YSQL webserver for better debugging of failures, by adding two new flags that log endpoint access and print basic tcmalloc stats respectively. The flags can be updated by sending a SIGHUP signal. Additionally, offers more visibility into the webserver's memory usage through the newly created `:13000/memz` and `:13000/webserver-heap-prof`. {{<issue 20157>}}
* Rectifies a segmentation fault issue in the Postmaster process in rare lock acquisition cases. {{<issue 20166>}}
* Enables postmaster restart when a backend process is unexpectedly terminated while in a critical section, preventing potential data corruption and system hangs. {{<issue 20255>}}
* Establishes `:13000/memz` and `:13000/webserver-heap-prof` endpoints to improve visibility into the webserver memory usage while managing tcmalloc stats and current allocations. Integrates a new runtime variable `yb_pg_metrics.webserver_profiler_sample_freq_bytes` to control tcmalloc sampling frequency. {{<issue 20157>}}
* Introduces the `pg_stat_statements.yb_qtext_size_limit` flag to control the maximum file size read into memory, preventing system crashes due to oversized or corrupt qtext files. {{<issue 20211>}}
* Limits the number of attempts to read inconsistent backend entries to 1000 and logs every hundredth attempt to prevent potentially infinite waiting loop. {{<issue 20274>}}
* Fixes a segmentation fault during cleanup phase in the webserver by ensuring `MyLatch` is used consistently throughout the process lifecycle. {{<issue 20309>}}
* Reduces excessive memory consumption during secondary index scans {{<issue 20275>}}
* Refines the computation of required batched/un-batched path parameters, eliminating the need to manually track non-batchable relations and simplifying logic. Fixes a bug affecting Nested Loop joins. {{<issue 19642>}},{{<issue 19946>}}
* Upgrades "Unknown session" error to FATAL permitting drivers to instantly terminate stale connections, minimizing manual user intervention. {{<issue 16445>}}
* Rectifies correctness issue when nested correlated subqueries uses sequential scan {{<issue 19694>}}
* Rectifies correctness issues when BatchNestedLoop join is used and the join condition contained a mix of equality and non-equality filters. {{<issue 20531>}}
* Rectifies correctness issue when join on inequality condition and join columns contains NULL values {{<issue 20642>}}
* Rectifies correctness issue when queries involving outer joins and aggregate uses BNL. {{<issue 20660>}}
* Corrects the Batch Nested Loop's optimization logic for proper handling of cases where the given limit matches the outer table's exact size, ensuring accurate query results. {{<issue 20707>}}
* Addresses a bug that caused backup failure due to the absence of `yb_catalog_version`, by ensuring the function's existence post-normal migration. {{<issue 18507>}}

#### DocDB

* Mitigates the issue of uneven tablet partitions and multiple pollers writing to the same consumer tablet by only applying intents on the consumer that match the producer tablet's key range. If some keys/values are filtered out from a batch, it will not delete the consumer's intents, as they may be needed by subsequent applications. Also guarantees idempotency, even if some `apply` records stutter and fetch older changes. {{<issue 19728>}}
* Reduces chances of transaction conflicts upon promotion by delaying the sending of UpdateTransactionStatusLocation RPCs until after the first PROMOTED heartbeat response is received, enhancing transaction consistency and accuracy. {{<issue 17319>}}
* Resolves potential `WriteQuery` leak issue in CQL workloads, ensuring proper execution and destruction of queries, while preventing possible tablet shutdown blockages during conflict resolution failure. {{<issue 19919>}}
* Unblocks single shard waiters once a blocking sub-transaction rolls back, by applying identical conflict check logic for both distributed transactions and single shard transactions. {{<issue 20113>}}
* Eliminates a race condition that can occur when simultaneous calls to `SendAbortToOldStatusTabletIfNeeded` try to send the abort RPC, thus preventing avoidable FATALs for failed geo promotions. {{<issue 17113>}}
* Deprecates the `enable_process_lifetime_heap_sampling` flag and allows to control tcmalloc sampling via the `profiler_sample_freq_bytes` flag alone, enhancing user control over database sampling settings. {{<issue 20236>}}
* Resolves instances of the leaderless tablet endpoint incorrectly reporting a tablet as leaderless post-leader change, by tweaking the detection logic to depend on the last occurrence of a valid leader, ensuring more accurate tablet reporting. {{<issue 20124>}}
* Allows early termination of ReadCommitted transactions with a `kConflict` error, enhancing overall system throughput by eliminating unnecessary blockages without waiting for the next RPC restart. {{<issue 20329>}}
* Modifies SysCatalog tablet's retryable request retention duration to consider both YQL and YSQL client timeouts, reducing the likelihood of `request is too old` errors during YSql DDLs. {{<issue 20330>}}
* Fixes FATAL errors occurring during tablet participant shutdown due to in-progress RPCs by ensuring `rpcs_.Shutdown` is invoked after all status resolvers have been shut down. {{<issue 19823>}}
* Handles backfill responses gracefully even when they overlap across multiple operations, reducing risks of crashes and errors due to network delays or slow masters. {{<issue 20510>}}

#### CDC

* Corrects the computation of the `cdcsdk_sent_lag` metric to prevent steep, disproportionate increases by updating the `last_sent_record_time` when a `SafePoint` record is spotted, in addition to DMLs and `READ` ops. {{<issue 15415>}}
* Adjusts table drop process to shift CDCSDK streams from ACTIVE to DELETING_METADATA state, enhancing the ability to add new tables to streams even after a table drop. {{<issue 20428>}}

#### Other

* Adjusts `tserver start` and `tserver stop` scripts to successfully terminate all running PG processes, irrespective of their PID digit count. {{<issue 19817>}}

* Fixes an intermittent index creation failure by checking the result of `is_running`, ensuring stability for empty YCQL tables, and preventing retain_delete_markers from being incorrectly set. {{<issue 19933>}}
* Resolves a concurrency issue in MasterChangeConfigTest by operating on a copy of `ExternalMaster*` to prevent timing out when removing a follower with a transitioning server. {{<issue 19927>}}
* Allows a single heap profile run at a time, preventing concurrent running that causes inconsistent sampling frequencies, enhancing the accuracy of these profiles. {{<issue 19841>}}
* Resolves data inconsistency between source and target instances during xCluster +Transactions +Aggressive tablet Splitting operations. Now, ensures accurate application of intents matching the producer tablet's key range on the consumer, facilitating correct data replication in diverse transaction scenarios. {{<issue 19728>}}

#### CDC

* Allows continuation of tablet fetching, even if certain tables face errors, by logging a warning instead of sending unnecessary errors to the client. {{<issue 19434>}}
* Returns error to the client if reading the `cdc_state` fails, ensuring consistent and correct list of tablets, enabling your client to take suitable action. {{<issue 19428>}}
* Eliminates deadlocks during database drops by properly handling namespace-level CDC stream deletion and setting up the database deletion process to finish in a finite time. {{<issue 19879>}}
* Adjusts CDCSDK's Catalog Manager to delete entries from `cdc_state` on new tablets, resolving race conditions due to tablet split and ensuring accurate metadata cleanup in cdc_state table for dropped tables. {{<issue 19746>}}

#### Other

* Avoids a segmentation fault in the stats collector following a Postmaster reset, solving potential crashes experienced when queries are terminated by SIGSEGV or SIGKILL. {{<issue 19672>}}

* Eliminates potential crashes by adding nullity checks to `CDCServiceImpl::GetChanges` that previously could return a null pointer. {{<issue 19524>}}

* Allows for the dynamic adjustment of previously hardcoded ports such as `master_rpc_port`, `tserver_webserver_port`, and `master_webserver_port` based on user's custom configurations, thereby facilitating successful creation of multi-region/zone clusters even with non-default port settings. {{<issue 15334>}}

### Docker

```sh
docker pull yugabytedb/yugabyte:2.18.1.0-b84
```

### Highlights

<!--* Explain Analyze provides additional details, including the number of RPCs to the storage layer, total network + storage time, system catalog RPC count and time for each query's output.-->
* Improvements to [xCluster](../../../deploy/multi-dc/async-replication/), including:
  * Support for [transactional atomicity](../../../deploy/multi-dc/async-replication-transactional/)
  * Faster bootstrapping
  * Automatic transfer of the source universe certificate when new nodes are added to the target universe
  * Ability to set up replication even if matching tables do not exist on the target universe
  * Improved performance and reliability when gathering replication stream statuses
  * Disallowing replication between two YugabyteDB versions that are incompatible
* View [latency histograms](../../../explore/query-1-performance/pg-stat-statements/#yb-latency-histogram-column) for queries using the yb_latency_histogram column in pg_stat_statements
* Faster nested loops with batching. Requests to YB-TServers are batched during joins using a new join execution method referenced as Batched Nested Loop, and derived from classic nested loop joins.
