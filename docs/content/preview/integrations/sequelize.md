This document describes how to use [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/), a promise-based Node.js object-relational mapping (ORM), with YugabetyDB.

## Prerequisites

Before you can start using Sequelize, ensure that you have the following available:

- YugabyteDB version 2.4 or later (see [Quick Start](/preview/tutorials/quick-start/)).

- Node.js (see [Downloading and installing Node.js](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-installer-to-install-node-js-and-npm)).

- A sample project for use with Sequelize. If you do not have a project, you can create it by executing the following commands:

  ```shell
  mkdir demo_project && cd demo_project
  mkdir node_modules
  touch demo.js
  ```

- A YugabyteDB-specific Sequelize package called [sequelize-yugabytedb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sequelize-yugabytedb). You can install this package by running the following command from the `demo_project` directory:

  ```shell
  npm install sequelize-yugabytedb
  ```

  Currently, the `sequelize-yugabytedb` package extends Sequelize version 6.6.5.

## Using Sequelize

To start using Sequelize with YugabyteDB, add the following code to the `demo.js` file:

```javascript
const { Sequelize } = require('sequelize-yugabytedb');

//first three arguments are database, username, password
const sequelize = new Sequelize('yugabyte', 'yugabyte', 'yugabyte',
  {
    host: 'localhost',
    port: '5433',
    dialect: 'postgres'
  }
)
// define a model with "customer" modelname
const Customer = sequelize.define('customer', {
  id: {
    type: Sequelize.INTEGER,
    primaryKey: true
  },
  name: {
    type: Sequelize.STRING
  },
})
//create "customers" table
Customer.sync({force: true})
.then(function() {
  //insert 2 rows into the table
  Customer.create({id: 1, name: "Bob"})
  Customer.create({id: 2, name: "Tom"})
})
```

To run the application, execute the following command:

```shell
node demo.js
```

## Testing the code

You can verify the code execution by looking for the changes inside the database, as follows:

- Navigate to your YugabyteDB installation directory by running the following command:

  ```shell
  cd /<path-to-yugabytedb>
  ```

- Run the ysqlsh client by executing the following command:

  ```sh
  ./bin/ysqlsh
  ```

- Obtain the list of all the tables in the database by executing the following command:

  ```sql
  \dt
  ```

- Check if rows have been inserted into the table by executing the following:

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;
  ```

The following illustration presents the output:

The `createdAt` and `updatedAt` timestamp columns have been added automatically by Sequelize.
