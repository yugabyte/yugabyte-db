## Licenses

Source code in the [YugabyteDB repository](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/) is variously licensed under the Apache License 2.0 and the Polyform Free Trial License 1.0.0. A copy of each license can be found in the [licenses](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/tree/master/licenses) directory.

The build produces two sets of binaries:

- The entire database with all its features (including the enterprise ones) are licensed under the [Apache License 2.0](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/blob/master/licenses/APACHE-LICENSE-2.0.txt).
- The binaries that contain `-managed` in the artifact and help run a managed service are licensed under the [Polyform Free Trial License 1.0.0](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/blob/master/licenses/POLYFORM-FREE-TRIAL-LICENSE-1.0.0.txt).

By default, the build options generate only the Apache License 2.0 binaries.
