The YugabyteDB MCP Server is a lightweight, Python-based server that enables LLMs such as Anthropic's Claude to securely connect to and query YugabyteDB. It supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), an industry standard that allows AI tools to discover and use structured services like databases, file systems, or APIs.

With the YugabyteDB MCP Server, developers can:

- Explore YugabyteDB data using natural language prompts
- Generate AI-powered visualizations from query results
- Enable LLMs to safely issue read-only SQL queries
- Integrate instantly with tools like Claude Desktop, Cursor, and Windsurf

For more information about the YugabyteDB MCP Server, see [Unlock AI-Driven Data Experiences with YugabyteDB MCP Server](https://www.yugabyte.com/blog/yugabytedb-mcp-server-on-aws-marketplace/).

This tutorial walks you through using the YugabyteDB MCP Server to allow an AI application to access, query, analyze, and interpret data in your YugabyteDB database, using only natural language prompts.

The tutorial uses a YugabyteDB cluster running the [Northwind dataset](../../../../sample-data/northwind/). You connect [Claude](https://claude.com/product/overview) to this database using MCP, and then explore it using natural language prompts.

## Prerequisites

- YugabyteDB {{<release "2025.1">}} or later (stable), or {{<release "2.25.1">}} or later (preview)
- Python 3.10+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management
- [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download)

## Set up YugabyteDB MCP Server

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabytedb-mcp-server.git
cd yugabytedb-mcp-server
uv sync
```

## Set up YugabyteDB

1. [Download and install](https://download.yugabyte.com) YugabyteDB {{<release "2025.1">}} or later (stable), or {{<release "2.25.1">}} or later (preview).

1. Start a single-node cluster using [yugabyted](../../../../reference/configuration/yugabyted/).

    ```sh
    ./bin/yugabyted start --advertise_address=127.0.0.1
    ```

1. [Install the Northwind sample database](../../../../sample-data/northwind/#install-the-northwind-sample-database).

## Connect Claude to the server

1. In Claude Desktop, navigate to **Settings > Developer > Edit Config**.

1. Add a new mcpServer entry in the `claude_desktop_config.json`:

    ```json
    {
        "mcpServers": {
            "yugabytedb-mcp": {
                "command": "uv",
                "args": [
                    "--directory",
                    "/path/to/cloned/yugabytedb-mcp-server/",
                    "run",
                    "src/server.py"
                ],
                "env": {
                    "YUGABYTEDB_URL": "dbname=northwind host=localhost port=5433 user=yugabyte password=yugabyte"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    Replace the path, and database user and password as appropriate.

1. Restart Claude to apply changes.

## Prompt 1: Summarize the database

Prompt:

```text
Summarize the database you are connected to.
```

Claude does the following:

- Calls `summarize_database`.
- Lists all tables with schema and row counts.
- Describes what it sees in plain English.

Example output:

```output
This appears to be the classic Northwind database, a sample database 
commonly used for demos and tutorials. Here's a summary:

Database Overview
This is a typical e-commerce/trading company database with 14 tables 
and approximately 3,400 total rows of data.

Core Business Tables:

- orders (830 rows) - Customer orders with shipping details
- order_details (2,155 rows) - Line items for each order with pricing and quantities
- products (77 rows) - Product catalog with pricing and inventory
- customers (91 rows) - Customer information and contact details
- categories (8 rows) - Product categories

Supporting Tables:

- employees (9 rows) - Employee information including hierarchy (reports_to)
- suppliers (29 rows) - Product suppliers
- shippers (6 rows) - Shipping companies
- territories (53 rows) - Sales territories
- region (4 rows) - Geographic regions
- us_states (51 rows) - US state reference data

Junction Tables:

- employee_territories (49 rows) - Maps employees to territories
- customer_demographics (0 rows) - Empty demographic data
- customer_customer_demo (0 rows) - Empty customer-demographic mapping

This database supports typical business operations like order management, 
inventory tracking, employee territories, and supplier relationships. Would 
you like me to run any specific queries or analysis on this data?
```

## Prompt 2: Build a dashboard

Prompt:

```text
Build a dashboard with 3 visualizations:

- Monthly sales trend
- Top 10 customers by revenue
- Sales grouped by customer country
```

Claude does the following:

- Executes safe, read-only SQL queries.
- Aggregates and structures the results.
- Creates an interactive dashboard for the results.

All with no SQL required.

Example output:

```output
I've created an interactive sales dashboard with all three visualizations you requested:

1. Monthly Sales Trend - A line chart showing revenue progression from July 1996 to 
May 1998. You can see a clear upward trend with revenue growing from ~$27k to peaks 
of ~$123k per month.
2. Top 10 Customers by Revenue - A horizontal bar chart showing QUICK-Stop, Ernst 
Handel, and Save-a-lot Markets as the top three customers, each generating over $100k 
in revenue.
3. Sales by Country - A scrollable horizontal bar chart displaying all 21 countries, 
with USA and Germany leading at $245k and $230k respectively.

The dashboard features:

- Interactive tooltips showing exact values when you hover over data points
- Clean, modern design with a professional color scheme
- Responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- Currency formatting for easy readability

All data is pulled directly from your Northwind database and shows real sales patterns 
over the ~2-year period covered by the dataset.
```
