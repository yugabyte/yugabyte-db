When deploying database clusters using an on-premises provider, YugabyteDB Anywhere relies on you to manually create the VMs and provide these pre-created VMs to YugabyteDB Anywhere.

With the on-premises provider, you must provide one, three, five, or more VM(s) with the following installed:

- [Supported Linux OS](../#linux-os)
- [Additional software](../#additional-software)
- If you are not connected to the Internet, [additional software for airgapped](../#additional-software-for-airgapped-deployment)

## How to provision the nodes for use in a database cluster

After you have created the VMs, they must be provisioned with YugabyteDB and related software before they can be deployed in a universe.

How you provision nodes for use with an on-premises provider depends on the SSH access that you can grant YBA to provision nodes.
