Before you can upgrade your universe to a specific version of YugabyteDB, verify that the release is available in YugabyteDB Anywhere and, if necessary, import it.

To view the YugabyteDB releases that are available in your YugabyteDB Anywhere instance, do the following:

- Click the user profile icon and choose **Releases**.

    ![Releases](/images/yp/releases-list-2024.png)

You can filter the list by text and release type, and choose to display only allowed releases.

To view the release details, select a release in the list.

To delete or disable a release, click its corresponding **Actions**. Disabled releases are not available when creating universes.

{{< warning title="Importing a YugabyteDB release in YugabyteDB Anywhere" >}}
Note that by default, you cannot import the latest stable YugabyteDB versions (v2024.1.x) in preview YugabyteDB Anywhere versions (for example, v2.23.x).
To enable this import, you need to set the YugabyteDB Anywhere runtime flag `yb.allow_db_version_more_than_yba_version` to true. See [Manage runtime configuration settings](../../administer-yugabyte-platform/manage-runtime-config/).

## Import a release

If a release that you want to install or upgrade is not available, import it as follows:

1. On the **Releases** page, click **New Release** to open the **Import Database Release** dialog as shown in the following illustration:

    ![Import Release](/images/yp/import-releases-2024.png)

1. Choose whether to upload the release as a file, or download the release via a URL.

    - If uploading a file, click **Upload** and select the release file.

    - If loading the release from a URL, enter the URL of the storage location.

1. Click **Fetch Metadata**. YugabyteDB Anywhere obtains the release details from the file.

    If YugabyteDB Anywhere is unable to extract the release details, provide them manually by entering the release version and specifying the deployment type and architecture.

1. Click **Add Release**.

When imported, the release is added to the **Releases** list.

### Add an architecture for a release

If a release architecture that you want to install on a universe is not available, add it as follows:

1. On the **Releases** page, locate the release in the list and click the plus button in the **Imported Architecture** column, or click **Actions** and **Add Architecture** to open the **New Architecture** dialog.

1. Choose whether to upload the release as a file, or download the release via a URL.

    - If uploading a file, click **Upload** and select the release file.

    - If loading the release from a URL, enter the URL of the storage location.

1. Click **Fetch Metadata**. YugabyteDB Anywhere obtains the release details from the file.

    If YugabyteDB Anywhere is unable to extract the release details, provide them manually by entering the release version and specifying the deployment type and architecture.

1. Click **New Architecture**.

When imported, the architecture is added to the Release.

Note that for Kubernetes universes, if a new Kubernetes release architecture is required, perform the following steps:

1. [Create the release](#import-a-release) using the related YugabyteDB x86/ARM build.
1. Add a new architecture to the newly created release and provide the helm chart.

As metadata is pulled from the YugabyteDB build, this will populate all the required data fields when creating the release, and simplify adding the helm chart after.
