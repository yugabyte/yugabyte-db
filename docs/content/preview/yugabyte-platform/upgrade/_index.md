Keep YugabyteDB Anywhere up to date for the latest fixes and improvements, and to be able to [upgrade your universes](../manage-deployments/upgrade-software/) to the latest version of YugabyteDB. You cannot upgrade a universe to a version of YugabyteDB that is later than the version of YugabyteDB Anywhere.

You can upgrade YBA using the following methods:

| Method | Using | Use If |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| YBA&nbsp;Installer | yba-ctl CLI | Your installation already uses YBA Installer. |
| Kubernetes | Helm chart | You're deploying in Kubernetes. |
