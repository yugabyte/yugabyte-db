In YugabyteDB Aeon, database upgrades are automated and are performed during scheduled [maintenance windows](../cloud-maintenance/).

YugabyteDB Aeon notifies you of upcoming upgrades. When an upgrade is in progress, you have 48 hours to monitor your cluster and then either roll back the upgrade or finalize it. If you take no action, the upgrade is automatically finlized at the end of the monitoring period.

## Limitations

In addition to the usual cluster [operation locking](../#locking-operations), be aware of the following before performing an upgrade:

- [Backups](../backup-clusters/)
  - Backups taken on a newer version cannot be restored to clusters running a previous version.
  - Backups taken during the upgrade cannot be restored to clusters running a previous version.
  - Backups taken before the upgrade can be used for restore to the new version.
- [Point-in-time-restore](../aeon-pitr/) (PITR)
  - After the upgrade, PITR cannot be done to a time before the upgrade.
- [xCluster Disaster Recovery](../disaster-recovery/) (DR)
  - While upgrading the DR target, failover is not available.
  - While upgrading the DR source or target, switchover is not available.
- [YSQL major upgrade](#ysql-major-upgrade)
  - All DDL statements, except ones related to Temporary table and Refresh Materialized View are blocked for the duration of the upgrade. Consider executing all DDLs before the upgrade, and pause any jobs that might run DDLs. DMLs are allowed.
  - You should also upgrade your application client drivers to the new version. The client drivers are backwards compatible, and work with both the old and new versions of the database.

## YSQL major upgrade

Upgrading YugabyteDB from a version based on PostgreSQL 11 (v2024.2 and earlier) to a version based on PostgreSQL 15 (v2025.1 or later) requires additional steps.

### Pre-check

New PostgreSQL major versions add many new features and performance improvements, but also remove some older unsupported features and data types. You can only upgrade after you remove all deprecated features and data types from your databases.

Use the pre-check to make sure your cluster is compatible with the new major YSQL version.

After you are notified of an upcoming YSQL major upgrade, to perform the pre-check do the following:

1. Navigate to the cluster **Maintenance** tab.
1. Under **Scheduled Maintenance**, Select the maintenance task to disply the details.
1. Click **Run Pre-Check**.

If your cluster is not fully compatible with the YSQL major upgrade, the pre-check will fail. Click **View Report** to view a report of recommendations changes.

After a successful upgrade precheck, you can proceed with the usual database upgrade.

## Monitor the cluster

Once all the nodes have been upgraded, monitor the cluster to ensure it is healthy:

- Make sure workloads are running as expected and there are no errors in the logs.
- Check that all nodes are up and reachable.
- Check the [performance metrics](../../cloud-monitor/overview/) for spikes or anomalies.

If you have problems, you can [roll back](#roll-back-an-upgrade) during this time.

For upgrades that require finalizing, you can monitor for as long as you need, up to a _maximum recommended limit of two days_ to avoid operator errors that can arise from having to maintain two versions.

A subset of features that require format changes will not be available until the upgrade is finalized.

If you are satisfied with the upgrade:

- For upgrades that do not require finalizing, the upgrade is effectively complete.

- For upgrades that require finalizing, proceed to [Finalize](#finalize-an-upgrade) the upgrade.

## Roll back an upgrade

If you aren't satisfied with an upgrade, you can roll back to the version that was previously installed.

To roll back an upgrade, do the following:

1. Navigate to the cluster **Maintenance** tab.
1. Under **Scheduled Maintenance**, Select the maintenance task to disply the details.

1. Click **Roll Back**.

## Finalize an upgrade

When an upgrade is in progress, you have 48 hours to monitor your cluster and then either roll back the upgrade or finalize it. If you take no action, the upgrade is automatically finlized at the end of the monitoring period. Note that you can't roll back after you finalize.

To manually finalize an upgrade, do the following:

1. Navigate to the cluster **Maintenance** tab.
1. Under **Scheduled Maintenance**, Select the maintenance task to disply the details.

1. Click **Finalize Upgrade Now**.
