In the meantime, [create a Sandbox cluster](../cloud-basics/create-clusters/create-clusters-free/) to run a tutorial and [explore](../../explore/) YugabyteDB and distributed SQL.

After the free trial begins, you can use your credits to create dedicated clusters in a [variety of topologies](../cloud-basics/create-clusters-topology/), including:

- Single region multi zone
- Replicated across regions
- Partition by region
- Read replicas

Create a [billing profile](../cloud-admin/cloud-billing-profile/) and add a payment method any time. You won't be charged until your credits are used.

Only one free trial can be applied to an account.
