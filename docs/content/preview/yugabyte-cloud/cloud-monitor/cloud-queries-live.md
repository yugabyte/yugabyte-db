Evaluate the performance of running queries on your cluster using the **Live Queries** on the cluster **Perf Advisor** tab. You can use this data to:

- Visually identify relevant database operations.
- Evaluate query execution times.
- Discover potential queries for [tuning](../../../explore/query-1-performance/).

Live queries only shows queries "in-flight" (that is, currently in progress); queries that execute quickly might not show up by the time the display loads. There is no significant performance overhead on databases because the queries are fetched on-demand and are not tracked in the background.

You can choose between displaying YSQL and YCQL queries.

To filter the query list, enter query text in the filter field. To sort the list by column, click the column heading. Click **Edit Options** to select the columns to display.

To view query details, click the right-arrow button for the query in the list to display the **Query Details** sheet.

The following table describes the **Live Queries** column values.
