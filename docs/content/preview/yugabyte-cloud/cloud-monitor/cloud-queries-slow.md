Evaluate the performance of slow queries that have run on your cluster using the **Slow Queries** option on the cluster **Performance** tab.

{{< youtube id="hXphqRCQImQ" title="Monitor and optimize queries in YugabyteDB Aeon" >}}

Use this data to:

- Visually identify slower running database operations.
- Evaluate query execution times over time.
- Discover potential queries for [tuning](../../../explore/query-1-performance/).
- View latency percentile metrics, including P99, P95, P90, P50, and P25 percentiles.

Slow queries are only available for YSQL.

## View Slow Queries

To view slow queries, navigate to the cluster **Performance** tab and choose **Slow Queries**.

To filter the query list, enter query text in the filter field. To sort the list by column, click the column heading.

Click **Edit Options** to select the columns to display. The following table describes the **Slow Queries** column values.

| Column          | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Query           | The query statement.               |
| User            | The name of role used to access YSQL database.               |
| Database        | The YSQL database used by the query.                         |
| Avg time        | The average execution time (in milliseconds) for this query. |
| Count           | The total number of times this type of query has executed.   |
| Total time      | The total duration (in milliseconds) of all iterations this query has taken. |
| Rows            | The total number of database table rows returned across all iterations of this query. |
| Min time        | The minimum execution time (in milliseconds) for this query. |
| Max time        | The maximum execution time (in milliseconds) for this query. |
| Latency distribution | Histogram showing the latency distribution of the query. To view a full chart and display P99 percentiles, view the [Query Details](#query-details). |

To reset the slow queries list, click **Reset**. To update the slow queries list, click **Refresh**.

## Query details

To view query details, click the row for the query to display the **Query Details** sheet.

The query details show a full view of the query statement, along with all the column data, the P25, P50, P90, P95, and P99 latency metrics, and a chart of the latency histogram. The chart shows the query count by response time range, in milliseconds; linear and logarithmic views are available.

Latency histogram support is only available for clusters running YugabyteDB v2.18.1 or later, or v2.19.1 or later.
