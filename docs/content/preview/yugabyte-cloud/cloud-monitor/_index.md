### Alerts

Use YugabyteDB Aeon [Alerts](cloud-alerts/) to be automatically notified of potential problems. You can enable alerts for cluster, database, and billing criteria. Configure alerts from the **Alerts** page.

### Performance monitoring

Monitor database and cluster performance in real time. Access performance monitoring from the cluster **Performance** tab.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Metrics](overview/) | The cluster **Overview** and **Performance Metrics** tabs show a variety of performance metrics charted over time. Use cluster performance metrics to ensure the cluster configuration matches its performance requirements, and [scale the cluster vertically or horizontally](../cloud-clusters/configure-clusters/) as your requirements change. |
| [Live queries](cloud-queries-live/) | The cluster **Live Queries** tab shows the queries that are currently "in-flight" on your cluster. |
| [Slow queries](cloud-queries-slow/) | The cluster **YSQL Slow  Queries** tab shows queries run on the cluster, sorted by running time. Evaluate the slowest running YSQL queries that have been run on the cluster. |
| [Performance&nbsp;advisor](cloud-advisor/) | Scan clusters for performance optimizations, including index and schema changes, and detect potentially hot nodes. |

### Integrations

Integrate with third-party tools such as Datadog, Grafana Cloud, and Sumo Logic to export database metrics and logs for analysis.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Integrations](managed-integrations/) | Set up links to third-party monitoring tools. |
| [Metrics export](metrics-export/) | Export metrics to third-party monitoring tools. |
| [Log export](logging-export/) | Export database PostgreSQL query and audit logs to third-party monitoring tools. |

### Cluster activity

View cluster activity, node status, and database properties.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Database&nbsp;tables | Use the cluster **Tables** tab to see the cluster tables, and their database or namespace, and size. Note that table size is calculated from the sum of the write ahead logs (WAL) and sorted-string table (SST) files, across all nodes in the cluster. Changes to the database are first recorded to the WAL. Periodically, these logs are written to SST files for longer-term storage. During this process, the data is compressed. When this happens, you may observe a reduction in the total size of tables. |
| Node status | Use the cluster **Nodes** tab to see the nodes in the cluster and their status. |
| [Activity log](monitor-activity/) | The cluster **Activity** tab provides a running audit of changes made to the cluster. |

### System status

To view an uptime report for your account (Enterprise plan only) and the YugabyteDB Aeon system status, click the **System Status** icon in the bottom left corner.
