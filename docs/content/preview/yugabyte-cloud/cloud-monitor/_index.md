### Alerts

Use YugabyteDB Aeon [Alerts](cloud-alerts/) to be automatically notified of potential problems. You can enable alerts for cluster, database, and billing criteria. Configure alerts from the **Alerts** page.

### Performance monitoring

Monitor database and cluster performance in real time. Access performance monitoring from the cluster **Performance** tab.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [Metrics](overview/) | The cluster **Overview** and **Performance Metrics** tabs show a variety of performance metrics charted over time. Use cluster performance metrics to ensure the cluster configuration matches its performance requirements, and [scale the cluster vertically or horizontally](../cloud-clusters/configure-clusters/) as your requirements change. |
| [Live queries](cloud-queries-live/) | The cluster **Live Queries** tab shows the queries that are currently "in-flight" on your cluster. |
| [Slow queries](cloud-queries-slow/) | The cluster **YSQL Slow  Queries** tab shows queries run on the cluster, sorted by running time. Evaluate the slowest running YSQL queries that have been run on the cluster. |
| [Performance&nbsp;advisor](cloud-advisor/) | Scan clusters for performance optimizations, including index and schema changes, and detect potentially hot nodes. |

### Integrations

Integrate with third-party tools such as Datadog, Grafana Cloud, and Sumo Logic to export database metrics and logs for analysis.
