##### New features

- Self service [Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networking](../cloud-basics/cloud-vpcs/). Use VPC networks to lower network latencies and make your application and database infrastructure more secure. Create VPCs in AWS or GCP and peer them with application VPCs in the same cloud provider. VPC networking is managed on the **VPC Network** tab of the **Networking** page.
- Ability to [enable pre-bundled extensions](../cloud-clusters/add-extensions/) using the `CREATE EXTENSION` command. YugabyteDB includes [pre-bundled PostgreSQL extensions](../../explore/ysql-language-features/pg-extensions/) that are tested to work with YSQL. Admin users now have additional permissions to allow them to enable these extensions in databases. (If you need to install a database extension that is not pre-bundled, contact {{% support-cloud %}}
.)

##### New features

- Additional [performance metrics](../cloud-monitor/overview/). The new cluster **Performance Metrics** tab features new metrics including YSQL and YCQL operations per second, YSQL and YCQL latency, network bytes per second, and more. Use these metrics to ensure the cluster configuration matches its performance requirements.
- Ability to review running queries using the [Live Queries](../cloud-monitor/cloud-queries-live/) on the cluster **Performance** tab. Use this information to visually identify relevant database operations and evaluate query execution times.
- Ability to review slow YSQL queries using the [YSQL Slow Queries](../cloud-monitor/cloud-queries-slow/) on the cluster **Performance** tab. You can use this information to identify slower-running database operations, look at query execution times over time, and discover potential queries for tuning.

##### Database

- YugabyteDB updated to version 2.8. New clusters automatically use the new version. Existing clusters will be upgraded in the coming weeks.

#### November 18, 2021

##### New features

- Support for auditing account activity using the new **Activity** tab on the **Security** page. The tab provides a running audit of activity, including:

  - backups
  - cluster creation and modification
  - changes to account users and their roles
  - billing changes
  - allow list changes

- Support for multiple Admin users on your account, and Admin users can now change the role of existing users. You can also invite multiple users at once, and assign them a role (Developer or Admin) when you invite them. You manage users using the **Users** tab on the **Security** page.
- Additional charts on the **Invoices** on the **Usage & Billing** page, which break costs down by cluster and infrastructure (instance costs, storage, and data transfer) so that you can quickly evaluate your costs.

##### Fixes

- Developer users can now use Cloud Shell.

#### October 5, 2021

##### New features

- The [YugabyteDB Aeon Status](https://status.yugabyte.cloud/) page shows the current uptime status of YugabyteDB Aeon and the [Yugabyte Support Portal](https://support.yugabyte.com/), along with maintenance notices and incident reports.
- Ability to review cluster activity using the new cluster **Activity** tab.

#### September 15, 2021

##### New features

- Ability to [create clusters](../cloud-basics/create-clusters/) suitable for production workloads. YugabyteDB Aeon clusters support horizontal and vertical scaling, VPC peering, and scheduled and manual backups.
- Billing support. Set up a billing profile, manage payment methods, and review invoices on the [Billing](../cloud-admin/cloud-billing-profile) tab. (You must create a billing profile and add a payment method before you can create any clusters apart from your Sandbox cluster.)

#### September 8, 2021

This release includes the following features:

- Sandbox clusters (one per account)
- AWS and GCP cloud support
- IP allow lists for network security
- Cloud Shell for running SQL queries from your browser
- YSQL and YCQL API support
- Multiple users - invite additional users
- Encryption at rest and in transit

## Known issues

- **Missing Slow Queries** - On clusters with multiple nodes, in some circumstances some nodes may not return all query statements when requested. If this happens, the query statements will be missing from the Slow Queries page.
- **Slow Queries Reset** - When resetting Slow Queries, the query used for the reset remains in the table.
- **Tables** - In some instances in Sandbox clusters, the **Tables** tab will show all tables with a size of 0B.
- **Clusters** - No support for scaling vCPUs on single node clusters.
- **Metrics** - The **View Full Screen** option in charts on the cluster **Overview** and **Performance Metrics** pages does not work in some versions of Safari 14.0 (Big Sur).
- **Metrics** - Some clusters in European regions may show occasional spikes in the YSQL Operations/sec chart. This is due to cluster health checks and can be ignored.
- **Metrics** - For a cluster with read replicas with different IOPS provisioned (AWS only), the provisioned IOPS metric shows the same IOPS across all replicas.
- **Widely-dispersed regions** - For multi-region clusters with widely-dispersed regions, Performance Advisor, Slow Queries, and some metrics may not return any results.
- **Maximum number of regions** - Multi-region clusters and their read replicas are limited to a maximum of 8 regions.

#### Known issues in Cloud Shell

- If [Cloud Shell](../cloud-connect/connect-cloud-shell/) stops responding, close the browser tab and restart Cloud Shell.
- Occasionally, Cloud Shell will take longer than normal to load; subsequent loads will be faster.
