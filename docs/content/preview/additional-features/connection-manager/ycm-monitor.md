## Metrics

Use the following metrics to monitor YSQL Connection Manager.

| Metric Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| database_name (DB OID) | Specifies information regarding the database being used in each pool. |
| user_name (User OID) | Specifies information regarding the user being used in each pool. |
| active_logical_connections | Specifies on a pool-by-pool basis the number of active logical (client) connections.<br>An "active" logical connection corresponds to a session in an active transaction on a physical connection. |
| queued_logical_connections | Specifies on a pool-by-pool basis the number of queued logical connections.<br>A "queued" logical connection corresponds to a session that is queued up to attach to a physical connection. |
| waiting_logical_connections | Specifies on a pool-by-pool basis the number of waiting/idle logical connections.<br>A session that is neither queued to attach to a physical connection nor currently using a physical connection is in a "waiting" state. |
| active_physical_connections | Specifies on a pool-by-pool basis the number of active physical (server) connections.<br>(At the start of a transaction) After a server connection is picked up from the connection pool (or freshly created) to serve a logical connection, it is marked as "active". |
| idle_physical_connections | Specifies on a pool-by-pool basis the number of idle physical connections.<br>(At the end of a transaction) Once a server connection detaches from its logical connection and returns to the physical connection pool, it is marked as "idle". |
| sticky_connections | Specifies on a pool-by-pool basis the number of sticky connections.<br>Physical connections that do not return to the connection pool at the end of a transaction remain "stuck" to the logical connection for the lifetime of the session. |
| avg_wait_time_ns | Specifies on a pool-by-pool basis the time (in ns) on average clients have to be "queued" before attaching to a physical connection. |
| qps / tps | Specifies on a pool-by-pool basis some basic performance metrics.<br>qps = queries per second<br>tps = transactions per second |

Some further implications from these metrics:

- Interaction between logical and physical connection metrics
  - The sum of waiting, queued, and active logical connections signify the number of client connections that are currently open.
  - The sum of idle and active physical connections signify the number of server-side backend processes that have been spawned.
  - The number of active logical connections will always be equal to the number of active physical connections.
- Pool utilization (idle physical conns/waiting logical conns)
  - Generally it's acceptable to have idle physical connections, as they can be used for connection burst scenarios. You can configure the timeout for idle connections depending on your use case.
  - It makes sense to reduce `ysql_max_connections` such that active:idle ratio is higher, provided that idle connections are not completely extinguished in the long run.
- Queued clients
  - Usually okay to have some "queued" state clients. However, if clients start timing out or query latency is too high, increase `ysql_max_connections`.
- Sticky connections
  - Can be the cause for higher connection acquisition latency in some cases (sticky connections are destroyed once used).
  - Can be the cause for connection exhaustion/client wait timeout scenarios.

## Logging

Connection Manager offers various log levels that you can set using the flag `ysql_conn_mgr_log_settings`:

- log_debug
- log_query
- log_config
- log_session
- log_stats

The structure of a log line is as follows:

```sh
PID YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC log_level [clientID serverID] (context) This is a sample log!
```

For example:

```sh
2986790 2025-04-22 20:55:08.236 UTC debug [c960b6b7a6030 scb5ee95439f2] (reset) ReadyForQuery
```

Connection Manager logs are stored in the same directory as TServer logs, depending on your cluster setup. They are rotated daily and have the following file naming convention:

```sh
ysql-conn-mgr-YYYY-MM-DD_HHMMSS.log.PID
```

For example:

```sh
ysql-conn-mgr-2025-04-22_205456.log.2986790
```

is a log file created for a Connection Manager process with a PID of 2986790, which started logging at 20:54:56 UTC on 22nd April 2025.
