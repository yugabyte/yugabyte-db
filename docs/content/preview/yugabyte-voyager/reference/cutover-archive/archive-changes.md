The archive changes command limits the disk space used by the locally queued CDC events. After the changes from the local queue are applied on the target YugabyteDB database (and source-replica database), they are eligible for deletion. The command gives an option to archive the changes before deleting by moving them to another directory.

Note that even if some changes are applied to the target databases, locally queued CDC events are deleted only after the disk use exceeds 70%.
