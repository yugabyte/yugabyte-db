**Notes:** For an alphabetical listing of the JSON functions and operators, see the listing in the navigation bar.

There are two trivial typecast operators for converting between a `text` value that conforms to [RFC 7159](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7159) and a `jsonb` or `json` value, the ordinarily overloaded `=` operator, 12 dedicated JSON operators, and 23 dedicated JSON functions.

Most of the operators are overloaded so that they can be used on both `json` and `jsonb` values. When such an operator reads a subvalue as a genuine JSON value, then the result has the same data type as the input. When such an operator reads a subvalue as a SQL `text` value that represents the JSON value, then the result is the same for a `json` input as for a `jsonb` input.

Some of the functions have just a `jsonb` variant and a couple have just a `json` variant. Function names reflect this by starting with `jsonb_` or ending with `_jsonb`â€”and, correspondingly, for the `json` variants. The reason that this naming convention is used, rather than ordinary overloading, is that YSQL can distinguish between same-named functions when the specification of their formal parameters differ but not when their return types differ. Some of the JSON functions for a specific purpose differ only by returning a `json` value or a `jsonb` value. This is why a single consistent naming convention, a `b` variant and a plain variant, is used throughout.

When an operator or function has both a JSON value input and a JSON value output, the `jsonb` variant takes a `jsonb` input and produces a `jsonb` output; and, correspondingly, the `json` variant takes a `json` input and produces a `json` output. You can use the `ysqlsh` [`\df`](../../../../ysqlsh-meta-commands/#df-antws-pattern) meta-command to show the signature (that is, the data types of the formal parameters and the return value) of any of the JSON functions; but you cannot do this for the operators.

Check the full account of each to find its variant status. When an operator or function has both a `jsonb` and `json` variant, then only the `jsonb` variant is described. The functionality of the `json` variant can be trivially understood from the account of the `jsonb` functionality.

To avoid clutter in the tables, only the `jsonb` variants of the function names are mentioned except where only a `json` variant exists.

## Convert a SQL value to a JSON value

| Function or operator | jsonb | json | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [`::jsonb`](./typecast-operators/#) | yes | yes | `::jsonb` typecasts a SQL `text` value that conforms to RFC 7159 to a `jsonb` value. Use the appropriate one of  `::jsonb`, `::json`, or `::text` to typecast between any pair out of `text`, `json`, and `jsonb`, in the direction that you need. |
| [`to_jsonb()`](./to-jsonb/) | yes | yes | Convert a single SQL value of any primitive or compound data type, that allows a JSON representation, to a sematically equivaent `jsonb`, or `json`, value. |
| [`row_to_json()`](./row-to-json/) | | yes | Create a JSON _object_ from a SQL _record_. It has no practical advantage over `to_jsonb()`. |
| [`array_to_json()`](./array-to-json/) | | yes | Create a JSON _array_ from a SQL array value. It has no practical advantage over `to_jsonb()`. |
| [`jsonb_build_array()`](./jsonb-build-array/) | yes | yes | Create a JSON _array_ from a variadic list of values of arbitrary SQL data type. |
| [`jsonb_build_object()`](./jsonb-build-object/) | yes | yes | Create a JSON _object_ from a variadic list that specifies keys with values of arbitrary SQL data type. |
| [`jsonb_object()`](./jsonb-object/) | yes | yes | Create a JSON _object_ from SQL array values that specifiy keys with their values of SQL data type `text`. |
| [`jsonb_agg()`](./jsonb-agg/) | yes | yes | This is an aggregate function. (Aggregate functions compute a single result from a `SETOF` input SQL values.) It creates a JSON _array_ whose values are the JSON representations of the aggregated SQL values. |
| [`jsonb_object_agg()`](./jsonb-object-agg/) | yes | yes | This is an aggregate function. (Aggregate functions compute a single result from a `SETOF` input values.) It creates a JSON _object_ whose values are the JSON representations of the aggregated SQL values. It is most useful when these to-be-aggregated values are _"row"_ type values with two fields. The first represesnts the _key_ and the second represents the _value_ of the intended JSON _object_'s _key-value_ pair. |

## Convert a JSON value to another JSON value

| Function or operator | jsonb | json | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [`->`](./subvalue-operators/) | yes | yes | Read the value specified by a one-step path returning it as a `json` or `jsonb` value.  |
| [`#>`](./subvalue-operators/) | yes | yes | Read the value specified by a multi-step path returning it as a `json` or `jsonb` value. |
| [&#124;&#124;](./concatenation-operator/) | yes | | Concatenate two `jsonb` values. The rule for deriving the output value depends upon the JSON data types of the operands. |
| [`-`](./remove-operators/) | yes | | Remove key-value pair(s) from an _object_ or a single value from an _array_. |
| [`#-`](./remove-operators) | yes | | Remove a single key-value pair from an _object_ or a single value from an _array_ at the specified path. |
| [`jsonb_extract_path()`](./jsonb-extract-path/) | yes | yes | Provide the identical functionality to the `#>` operator. The path is presented as a variadic list of steps that must all be `text` values. Its invocation more verbose than that of the `#>` operator and there is no reason to prefer the function form to the operator form. |
| [`jsonb_strip_nulls()`](./jsonb-strip-nulls/) | yes | yes | Find all key-value pairs at any depth in the hierarchy of the supplied JSON compound value (such a pair can occur only as an element of an _object_) and return a JSON value where each pair whose value is _null_ has been removed. |
| [`jsonb_set()` and `jsonb_insert()`](./jsonb-set-jsonb-insert/) | yes | | Use `jsonb_set()` to change a JSON value, i.e. the value of an existing key-value pair in a JSON _object_ or the value at an existing index in a JSON array. Use `jsonb_insert()` to insert a value, either as the value for a key that doesn't yet exist in a JSON _object_ or beyond the end or before the start of the index range for a JSON _array_. |

## Convert a JSON value to a SQL value

| Function or operator | jsonb | json |Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [`::text`](./typecast-operators/) | yes | yes | Typecast a `jsonb`  value to a SQL `text` value that conforms to RFC 7159. Whitesace is conventioanally defined for a `jsonb` operand. Whitespace, in general, is unpredicatable for a `json` operand. |
| [`->>`](./subvalue-operators/) | yes | yes | Like `->` except that the targeted value is returned as a SQL `text` value: _either_ the `::text` typecast of a compound JSON value; _or_ a typecastable `text` value holding the actual value that a primitive JSON value represents. |
| [`#>>`](./subvalue-operators/) | yes | yes | Like `->>` except that the to-be-read JSON subvalue is specified by the path to it from the enclosing JSON value. |
| [`jsonb_extract_path_text()`](./jsonb-extract-path-text/) | yes | yes | Provide the identical functionality to the `#>>` operator. There is no reason to prefer the function form to the operator form. |
| [`jsonb_populate_record()`](./jsonb-populate-record/) | yes | yes | Convert a JSON _object_ into the equivalent SQL `record`. |
| [`jsonb_populate_recordset()`](./jsonb-populate-recordset/) | yes | yes | Convert a homogeneous JSON _array_ of JSON _objects_ into the equivalent set of SQL _records_. |
| [`jsonb_to_record()`](./jsonb-to-record/) | yes | yes | Convert a JSON _object_ into the equivalent SQL `record`. Syntax variant of the functionality that  `jsonb_populate_record()` provides. It has some restrictions and brings no practical advantage over its less restricted equivalent. |
| [`jsonb_to_recordset()`](./jsonb-to-recordset/) | yes | yes | Bears the same relationship to `jsonb_to_record()` as  `jsonb_populate_recordset()` bears to `jsonb_populate_record()`. Therefore, it brings no practical advantage over its restricted equivalent. |
| [`jsonb_array_elements()`](./jsonb-array-elements/) | yes | yes | Transform the JSON values of JSON _array_ into a SQL table of (i.e. `SETOF`) `jsonb` values. |
| [`jsonb_array_elements_text()`](./jsonb-array-elements-text/) | yes | yes | Transform the JSON values of JSON _array_ into a SQL table of (i.e. `SETOF`) `text` values. |
| [`jsonb_each()`](./jsonb-each/) | yes | yes | Create a row set with columns _"key"_ (as a SQL `text`) and _"value"_ (as a SQL `jsonb`) from a JSON _object_. |
| [`jsonb_each_text()`](./jsonb-each-text/) | yes | yes | Create a row set with columns _"key"_ (as a SQL `text`) and _"value"_ (as a SQL `text`) from a JSON _object_. |
| [`jsonb_pretty()`](./jsonb-pretty/) | yes | | Format the text representation of the JSON value that the input `jsonb` actual argument represents, using whitespace, to make it maximally human readable. |

## Get a property of a JSON value

| Function or operator | jsonb | json | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [`=`](./equality-operator/) | yes | | Test if two `jsonb` values are equal. |
| [`@>` and `<@`](./containment-operators/) | yes | | The `@>` operator tests if the left-hand JSON value contains the right-hand JSON value. The `<@` operator tests if the right-hand JSON value contains the left-hand JSON value. |
| [?, ?&#124;, and ?&](./key-or-value-existence-operators/) | yes | | (1) If the left-hand JSON value is an _object_, test if the right-hand SQL text value(s) exist as key name(s) in the _object_. (2) If the left-hand JSON value is an _array_, test if the right-hand SQL text value(s) exist as JSON _string_ value(s) in the _array_. |
| [`jsonb_array_length()`](./jsonb-array-length/) | yes | | Return the count of values (primitive or compound) in the array. You can use this to iterate over the elements of a JSON _array_ using the  `->` operator. |
| [`jsonb_typeof()`](./jsonb-typeof/) | yes | | Return the data type of the JSON value as a SQL `text` value. |
| [`jsonb_object_keys()`](./jsonb-object-keys/) | yes | | Transform the list of key names int the supplied JSON _object_ into a set (i.e. table) of `text` values. |
