## The function modeled_overlaps(timestamp, timestamp, timestamp, timestamp) returns boolean

This function models the _overlaps_ semantics using two distinct approaches:

- Using the `&&` operator with two _range_ values.
- From first principles using ordinary if-the-else logic.

It considers just this invocation syntax:

```output
overlaps_result ◄— (left-duration-bound-1, left-duration-bound-2) overlaps (right-duration-bound-1, right-duration-bound-2)
```

The other overloads:

- that define one duration using a pair of moments and one using a moment and a duration size
- that define both durations using a moment and a duration size

can be trivially expressed as wrappers around the overload that defines both durations using a pair of moments.

The model addresses just the overload that specifies each duration by a pair of plain _timestamp_ bounds. The corresponding overloads for plain _time_ and _timestamptz_ can be trivially derived from this.

This page's parent page, in the section [_overlaps_ semantics in prose](../#overlaps-semantics-in-prose), explained that the _overlaps_ operator result is insensitive, for each of the two durations on which it acts, to the ordering of the moment arguments that define the duration's bounds—and that it is also insensitive to which duration is given as the left duration and which is given as the right duration. However, the implementation needs to distinguish between the start and the finish moments and needs to know how the two durations are mutually ordered. In other words, it models this invocation syntax:

```output
overlaps_result ◄— (earlier-duration-start-moment, earlier-duration-finish-moment) overlaps (later-duration-start-moment, later-duration-finish-moment)
```

The implementation therefore starts by deriving these values:

```output
earlier_start, earlier_finish, later_start, later_finish
```

from these input values:

```output
left_1, left_2, right_1, right_2
```

Create the function _modeled_overlaps()_ thus:

```plpgsql
drop function if exists modeled_overlaps(timestamp, timestamp, timestamp, timestamp) cascade;

create function modeled_overlaps(left_1 in timestamp, left_2 in timestamp, right_1 in timestamp, right_2 in timestamp)
  returns boolean
  language plpgsql

        case
          when left_finish < right_finish then true
          else                           false
        end
    end;

    earlier_start  := right_start;
    earlier_finish := right_finish;
    later_start    := left_start;
    later_finish   := left_finish;
  end if;
  declare
    -- Modeled using the && operator with two range values.
    -- Accommodate the fact that if the bounds of a '[)' range, r, coincide,
    -- then isempty(r) evaluates to TRUE by using a '[]' range instead.
    r1 constant tsrange not null :=
      case
        when earlier_start = earlier_finish then tsrange(earlier_start, earlier_finish, '[]')
        else                                     tsrange(earlier_start, earlier_finish, '[)')

    r2 constant tsrange not null :=

        else                                 tsrange(later_start, later_finish, '[)')
      end;

    modeled_using_ranges boolean not null := r1 && r2;

    -- Modeled from first principles using ordinary if-the-else logic.
    modeled_from_first_principles boolean not null :=
      case
        -- Special case: both are instants
        when (earlier_finish = earlier_start) and (later_finish = later_start) then
          case

            else                                  false
          end

## The function modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps(timestamp, timestamp, timestamp, timestamp) returns modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps_result

This function returns a _user-defined type_ value that represents the return value from the native _overlaps_ operator together with the return value from _modeled_overlaps()_, for the same parameterization of the two durations, as a pair of _boolean_ values.

Create the type _modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps_result_ and the function _modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps)_ thus:

```plpgsql
drop type if exists modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps_result cascade;

create type modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps_result as (o boolean, m boolean);

drop function if exists modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps(timestamp, timestamp, timestamp, timestamp) cascade;

create function modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps(left_1 in timestamp, left_2 in timestamp, right_1 in timestamp, right_2 in timestamp)
  returns modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps_result
  language plpgsql
as $body$
declare
  o     constant boolean not null :=                 (left_1, left_2) overlaps (right_1, right_2);
  m     constant boolean not null := modeled_overlaps(left_1, left_2,           right_1, right_2);
begin
  return (o, m)::modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps_result;
end;
$body$;
```

## The function modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps_display(timestamp, timestamp, timestamp, timestamp) returns text

This function creates a _text_ value from the parameterization of the two durations that encodes:

- the _left_1_, _left_2_, _right_1_, and _right_2_ plain _timestamp_ values
- the result, _true_ or _false_ from the native _overlaps_ operator
- only if the result from _modeled_overlaps()_ is different from the result from the native _overlaps_ operator, then it appends _DISAGREE_.

It also adds a significant test of its own. For each supplied parameterization, _(left_1, left_2, right_1, right_2)_, it invokes _modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps()_ with each of the eight parameter orderings that supposedly express the same semantics:

- _(left_1, left_2, right_1, right_2)_
- _(left_2, left_1, right_1, right_2)_
- _(left_1, left_2, right_2, right_1)_
- _(left_2, left_1, right_2, right_1)_
- _(right_1, right_2, left_1, left_2)_
- _(right_2, right_1, left_1, left_2)_
- _(right_1, right_2, left_2, left_1)_
- _(right_2, right_1, left_2, left_1)_

and it tests that all of these invocations produce the same result.

First create the helper procedure _assert_r1_equals_r(int, modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps_result, modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps_result)_ to test if the result from the invocation that uses one of the second through the eighth orderings is identical to the result from the invocation that uses the first ordering.

```plpgsql
drop procedure if exists assert_r1_equals_r(int, modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps_result, modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps_result) cascade;

create procedure assert_r1_equals_r(test_nr in int, r1 in modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps_result, r in modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps_result)
  language plpgsql
as $body$
declare
  o1 constant boolean not null := r1.o;
  m1 constant boolean not null := r1.m;
  o  constant boolean not null :=  r.o;
  m  constant boolean not null :=  r.m;

  msg constant text not null := 'Test number '||test_nr::text||' assert failed';
begin
  assert ((o1 = o) and (m1 = m)), msg;
end;
$body$;
```

Now create the function _modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps_display()_:

```plpgsql
drop function if exists modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps_display(timestamp, timestamp, timestamp, timestamp) cascade;

create function modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps_display(left_1 in timestamp, left_2 in timestamp, right_1 in timestamp, right_2 in timestamp)
  returns text
  language plpgsql
as $body$
declare
  input constant text      not null := rpad(left_1||', '  ::text, 29)||
                                       rpad(left_2        ::text, 27)||' |   ' ||
                                       rpad(right_1||', ' ::text, 29)||
                                       rpad(right_2       ::text, 27)||'   ';

  o1             boolean   not null := false;
  m1             boolean   not null := false;
  o              boolean   not null := false;
  m              boolean   not null := false;

  r              modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps_result;
  r1             modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps_result;
begin
  for j in 1..8 loop
    case j
      when 1 then
        r1 := modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps(left_1, left_2, right_1, right_2);
        o1 := r1.o;
        m1 := r1.m;

      when 2 then
        r  := modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps(left_2, left_1, right_1, right_2);
        call assert_r1_equals_r(1, r1, r);

      when 3 then
        r  := modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps(left_1, left_2, right_2, right_1);
        call assert_r1_equals_r(2, r1, r);

      when 4 then
        r  := modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps(left_2, left_1, right_2, right_1);
        call assert_r1_equals_r(3, r1, r);

      when 5 then
        r  := modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps(right_1, right_2, left_1, left_2);
        call assert_r1_equals_r(4, r1, r);

      when 6 then
        r  := modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps(right_2, right_1, left_1, left_2);
        call assert_r1_equals_r(5, r1, r);

      when 7 then
        r  := modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps(right_1, right_2, left_2, left_1);
        call assert_r1_equals_r(6, r1, r);

      when 8 then
        r  := modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps(right_2, right_1, left_2, left_1);
        call assert_r1_equals_r(7, r1, r);
    end case;

    return
      case (m1 = o1)
        when true then input||o1::text
        else           input||rpad(o1::text, 6)||'DISAGREE'
      end;
  end loop;
end;
$body$;
```

## The function modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps_report() returns table(z text)

This table function simply invokes _modeled_overlaps_vs_overlaps_display()_ for all of the parameterizations that correspond to the interesting cases that are shown in the picture in this page's parent page in the section [_overlaps_ semantics in pictures](../#overlaps-semantics-in-pictures). It also adds a few more tests. Create it thus:

```plpgsql

  returns table(z text)
  language plpgsql
