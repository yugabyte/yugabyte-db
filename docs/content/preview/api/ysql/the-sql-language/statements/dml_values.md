## Synopsis

Use the `VALUES` statement to generate a row set specified as an explicitly written set of explicitly written tuples.

## Syntax

{{%ebnf%}}
  values,
  expression_list
{{%/ebnf%}}

## Semantics

### expression_list

A comma separated list of parenthesized expression lists. The degenerate form is just a single constant, thus:

```plpgsql
values ('dog'::text);
```
This is the result:

```
 column1
---------
 dog
```

The result has as many columns named _"column1"_, _"column2"_, ... _"columnN"_ as there are expressions in the expression list, thus:

```plpgsql
values
  (1::int, '2019-06-25 12:05:30'::timestamp, 'dog'::text),
  (2::int, '2020-07-30 13:10:45'::timestamp, 'cat'::text);
```
This is the result:

```
 column1 |       column2       | column3
---------+---------------------+---------
       1 | 2019-06-25 12:05:30 | dog
       2 | 2020-07-30 13:10:45 | cat
```
If an expression is written without a typecast, then its data type is inferred. For example, _'dog'_ is inferred to have data type `text` and _4.2_ is inferred to have data type `numeric`.

Each successive parenthesized expression list must specify the same number of expressions with the same data types. Try this counter example:

```plpgsql
values
  (1::int, '2019-06-25 12:05:30'::timestamp, 'dog'::text),
  (2::int, '2020-07-30 13:10:45'::timestamp, 'cat'::text, 42::int);
```

It causes this error:

```
42601: VALUES lists must all be the same length
```

And try this counter example:

```plpgsql
values (1::int), ('x'::text);
```
It causes this error:

```
42804: VALUES types integer and text cannot be matched
```

### The ORDER BY, LIMIT, OFFSET, and FETCH clauses

These clauses have the same semantics when they are used in a `VALUES` statement as they do when they are used in a `SELECT` statement.

## Example

A `VALUES` statement can be used as a subquery by surrounding it with parentheses, and giving this an alias, in just the same way that a `SELECT` statement can be so surrounded and so used. Try this first:

```plpgsql
select chr(v) as c from (
  select * from generate_series(97, 101)
  ) as t(v);
```

This is the result:

```
 c
---
 a
 b
 c
 d
 e
```

Now use a `VALUES` statement (on line #2) within the parentheses instead of the `SELECT` statement:

```plpgsql
select chr(v) as c from (
  values (100), (111), (103)
  ) as t(v);
```

This is the result:

```
 c
---
 d
 o
 g
```
