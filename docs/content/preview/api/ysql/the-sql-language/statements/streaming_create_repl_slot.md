{{< tip title="Requires replication connection." >}}
This command can only be executed on a walsender backend which can be started by establishing a replication connection. A replication connection can be created by passing the parameter `replication=database` in the connection string. Refer to examples section.

## Synopsis

Use the `CREATE_REPLICATION_SLOT` statement to create a replication slot.

## Syntax

{{%ebnf%}}
  create_replication_slot
{{%/ebnf%}}

## Semantics

### *slot_name*

The name of the replication slot. The name of the replication slot must be **unique across all databases**.

### *output_plugin*

The name of the output plugin used for logical decoding.

### NOEXPORT_SNAPSHOT / USE_SNAPSHOT

Decides what to do with the snapshot created during logical slot initialization.

`USE_SNAPSHOT` indicates the intention of the client to consume the snapshot. This option must be used in a transaction, and `CREATE_REPLICATION_SLOT` must be the first command run in that transaction.

`NOEXPORT_SNAPSHOT` will just use the snapshot for logical decoding as normal but won't do anything else with it.

## Examples

Establish a replication connection to the database `yugabyte`.

```sql
bin/ysqlsh "dbname=yugabyte replication=database"
```

Create a Replication Slot with name *test_replication_slot* and use the `yboutput` plugin.

```sql
yugabyte=# CREATE_REPLICATION_SLOT test_replication_slot LOGICAL yboutput;
```

Create a Replication Slot with name test_replication_slot and use the `pgoutput` plugin.

```sql
yugabyte=# CREATE_REPLICATION_SLOT test_replication_slot LOGICAL pgoutput;
```
