pg_hint_plan documentation
==========================

Introduction
------------

Markdown format is kept as a main format, relying on python sphinx and
myst_parser to render an HTML documentation if needed.

Note that while markdown is more readable as raw text, it's a way simpler
syntax that lacks a lot of features that reStructuredText offers.  Relying on
sphinx gives us an opportunity to later write parts of the documentation in
reStructuredText if needed, but also offers other appealing features like
multilingual documentation that we may reintroduce in a near future.

Readthedocs is the expected target, so use its theme and follow its
recommendation about pinning various requirement versions.

Building the doc locally
------------------------

The documentation can be built locally easily using

make -C docs/ html

The rendered documentation will be generated in docs/html/_build/html

Note that you need to have all python prerequirements installed, which can be
done using:

pip install -r docs/requirements.txt

If you need to update the requirements (which shouldn't be needed frequently),
update the docs/requirements.in and generate the target docs/requirements.txt
using pip-compile.  See the link about this tool below for more details on how
to use it.

As a first step, simply duplicate the README.md for the documentation.
