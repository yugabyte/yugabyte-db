# This module defines
# GMOCK_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find gmock include files, etc.
# GTEST_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find gtest include files
# GMOCK_SHARED_LIBRARY, Location of libgmock's shared library
# GMOCK_STATIC_LIBRARY, Location of libgmock's static library
# GMOCK_FOUND, If false, do not try to use gmock.
