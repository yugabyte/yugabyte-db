ASH is currently available for YSQL, YCQL, and YB-TServer and records wait events like CPU, WaitOnCondition, RPCWait, and Disk IO.

By analyzing this data, you can troubleshoot performance by answering questions like:

- Why is a specific query or application slow?

- Which queries are causing the most database load?

## Configure ASH

To configure ASH, you can set the following YB-TServer flags for each node of your cluster.

| Flag | Description |
| :--- | :---------- |
| ysql_yb_enable_ash | Enables ASH. Changing this flag requires a TServer restart. Default: true |
| ysql_yb_ash_circular_buffer_size | Size (in KiB) of circular buffer where the samples are stored. <br> Defaults:<ul><li>32 MiB for 1-2 cores</li><li>64 MiB for 3-4 cores</li><li>128 MiB for 5-8 cores</li><li>256 MiB for 9-16 cores</li><li>512 MiB for 17-32 cores</li><li>1024 MiB for more than 32 cores</li></ul> Changing this flag requires a TServer restart. |
| ysql_yb_ash_sampling_interval_ms | Sampling interval (in milliseconds). Changing this flag doesn't require a TServer restart. Default: 1000 |
| ysql_yb_ash_sample_size | Maximum number of events captured per sampling interval. Changing this flag doesn't require a TServer restart. Default:  500 |

## YSQL views

ASH exposes the following views in each node to analyze and troubleshoot performance issues.

### yb_active_session_history

This view provides a list of wait events and their metadata. The columns of the view are described in the following table.

| Column | Type | Description |
| :----- | :--- | :---------- |
| sample_time | timestamp | Timestamp when the sample was captured |
| root_request_id | UUID | A 16-byte UUID that is generated per request. Generated for queries at YSQL/YCQL layer. |
| rpc_request_id | integer | ID for internal requests, it is a monotonically increasing number for the lifetime of a YB-TServer. |
| wait_event_component | text | Component of the wait event, which can be YSQL, YCQL, or TServer. |
| wait_event_class | text | Class of the wait event, such as TabletWait, RocksDB, and so on.  |
| wait_event | text | Name of the wait event. |
| wait_event_type | text | Type of the wait event such as CPU, WaitOnCondition, RPCWait, Disk IO, and so on. |
| wait_event_aux | text | Additional information for the wait event. For example, tablet ID for TServer wait events. |
| top_level_node_id | UUID | 16-byte TServer UUID of the YSQL/YCQL node where the query is being executed. |
| query_id | bigint | Query ID as seen on the `/statements` endpoint. This can be used to join with [pg_stat_statements](../../../launch-and-manage/monitor-and-alert/query-tuning/pg-stat-statements/)/[ycql_stat_statements](../../../launch-and-manage/monitor-and-alert/query-tuning/ycql-stat-statements/). See [Constant query identifiers](#constant-query-identifiers). |
| pid | bigint | PID of the process that is executing the query. For YCQL and background activities, this will be the YB-TServer PID. |
| client_node_ip | text | IP address of the client which sent the query to YSQL/YCQL. Null for background activities. |
| sample_weight | float | If in any sampling interval there are too many events, YugabyteDB only collects `ysql_yb_ash_sample_size` samples/events. Based on how many were sampled, weights are assigned to the collected events. <br><br>For example, if there are 200 events, but only 100 events are collected, each of the collected samples will have a weight of (200 / 100) = 2.0 |
| ysql_dbid | oid | Database OID of the YSQL database. This is 0 for YCQL databases.  |

### yb_wait_event_desc

This view displays the class, type, name, and description of each wait event. The columns of the view are described in the following table.

| Column | Type | Description |
| :----- | :--- | :---------- |
| wait_event_class | text | Class of the wait event, such as TabletWait, RocksDB, and so on. |
| wait_event_type | text | Type of the wait event such as CPU, WaitOnCondition, RPCWait, Disk IO, and so on. |
| wait_event | text | Name of the wait event. |
| wait_event_description | text | Description of the wait event. |

## Constant query identifiers

These fixed constants are used to identify various YugabyteDB background activities. The query IDs of the fixed constants are described in the following table.

| Query ID | Wait Event Component | Description |
| :------- | :------------------- | :---------- |
| 1 | TServer | Query ID for write ahead log (WAL) appender thread. |
| 2 | TServer | Query ID for background flush tasks. |
| 3 | TServer | Query ID for background compaction tasks. |
| 4 | TServer | Query ID for Raft update consensus. |
| 5 | YSQL/TServer | Default query ID, assigned in the interim before pg_stat_statements calculates a proper ID for the query. |
| 6 | TServer | Query ID for write ahead log (WAL) background sync. |

To obtain the IP address and location of a node where a query is being executed, use the `top_level_node_id` from the active session history view in the following command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.yb_servers() WHERE uuid = <top_level_node_id>;
```

``` output
     host     | port | num_connections | node_type | cloud |  region   |    zone    | public_ip |               uuid
--------------+------+-----------------+-----------+-------+-----------+------------+-----------+----------------------------------
 10.9.111.111 | 5433 |               0 | primary   | aws   | us-west-2 | us-west-2a |           | 5cac7c86ba4e4f0e838bf180d75bcad5
```

## Limitations

Note that the following limitations are subject to change.

- ASH is available per node and is not aggregated across the cluster.
- ASH is not available for [YB-Master](../../../architecture/yb-master/) processes.
- ASH is available for queries and a few background activities like compaction and flushes. ASH support for other background activities will be added in future releases.
