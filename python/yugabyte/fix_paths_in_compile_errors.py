# This fixes file paths in compilation error output so that they become clickable in CLion.
# This became necessary when we started setting CCACHE_BASEDIR. In that case, it looks like ccache
# substitutes file paths relative to the current directory (which might be arbitrarily nested
# inside the build directory) into the compiler command line.
