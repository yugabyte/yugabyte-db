namespace yb {

// Certain behavior is disallowed on certain threads.  ThreadRestrictions helps
// enforce these rules.  Examples of such rules:
//
// * Do not do blocking IO
// * Do not wait on synchronization variables or sleep
//
// Here's more about how the protection works:
//
// 1) If a thread should not be allowed to make IO calls, mark it:
//      ThreadRestrictions::SetIOAllowed(false);
//    By default, threads *are* allowed to make IO calls.
//    In particular, threads like RPC reactors should never do blocking IO
//    because it may stall other unrelated requests.
//
// 2) If a function makes a call that will go out to disk, check whether the
//    current thread is allowed:
//      ThreadRestrictions::AssertIOAllowed();
//
//
// Style tip: where should you put AssertIOAllowed checks?  It's best
// if you put them as close to the disk access as possible, at the
// lowest level.  This rule is simple to follow and helps catch all
// callers.  For example, if your function GoDoSomeBlockingDiskCall()
// only calls other functions in YB and doesn't access the underlying
// disk, you should go add the AssertIOAllowed checks in the helper functions.
