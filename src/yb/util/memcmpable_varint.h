// This is an alternate varint format, borrowed from sqlite4, that differs from the
// varint in util/coding.h in that its serialized form can be compared with memcmp(),
// yielding the same result as comparing the original integers.
//
// The serialized form also has the property that multiple such varints can be strung
// together to form a composite key, which itself is memcmpable.
//
// See memcmpable_varint.cc for further description.
