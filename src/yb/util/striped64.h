// This set of classes is heavily derived from JSR166e, released into the public domain

// See: http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/jsr166/src/jsr166e/LongAdder.java?view=co
//
// The Striped64 and LongAdder implementations here are simplified versions of what's present in
// JSR166e. However, the core ideas remain the same.
//
// Updating a single AtomicInteger in a multi-threaded environment can be quite slow:
//
//   1. False sharing of cache lines with other counters.
//   2. Cache line bouncing from high update rates, especially with many cores.
//
// These two problems are addressed by Striped64. When there is no contention, it uses CAS on a
// single base counter to store updates. However, when Striped64 detects contention
// (via a failed CAS operation), it will allocate a small, fixed size hashtable of Cells.
// A Cell is a simple POD that pads out an AtomicInt to 64 bytes to prevent
// sharing a cache line.
//
// Reading the value of a Striped64 requires traversing the hashtable to calculate the true sum.
//
// Each updating thread uses a thread-local hashcode to determine its Cell in the hashtable.
// If a thread fails to CAS its hashed Cell, it will do a lightweight rehash operation to try
// and find an uncontended bucket. Because the hashcode is thread-local, this rehash affects all
// Striped64's accessed by the thread. This is good, since contention on one Striped64 is
// indicative of contention elsewhere too.
//
// The hashtable is statically sized to the nearest power of 2 greater than or equal to the
// number of CPUs. This is sufficient, since this guarantees the existence of a perfect hash
// function. Due to the random rehashing, the threads should eventually converge to this function.
// In practice, this scheme has shown to be sufficient.
//
// The biggest simplification of this implementation compared to JSR166e is that we do not
// dynamically grow the table, instead immediately allocating it to the full size.
// We also do not lazily allocate each Cell, instead allocating the entire array at once.
// This means we waste some additional memory in low contention scenarios, and initial allocation
// will also be slower. Some of the micro-optimizations were also elided for readability.
