// Read-Write semaphore. 32bit uint that contains the number of readers.
// When someone wants to write, tries to set the 32bit, and waits until
// the readers have finished. Readers are spinning while the write flag is set.
//
// This rw-semaphore makes no attempt at fairness, though it does avoid write
// starvation (no new readers may obtain the lock if a write is waiting).
//
// Given that this is currently based only on spinning (and not futex),
// it should only be used in cases where the lock is held for very short
// time intervals.
//
// If the semaphore is expected to always be released from the same thread
// that acquired it, use rw_spinlock instead.
//
// In order to support easier debugging of leaked locks, this class can track
// the stack trace of the last thread to lock it in write mode. To do so,
// uncomment the following define:
//   #define RW_SEMAPHORE_TRACK_HOLDER 1
// ... and then in gdb, print the contents of the semaphore, and you should
// see the collected stack trace.
