  // The size amplification is defined as the amount (in percentage) of
  // additional storage needed to store a single byte of data in the database.
  // For example, a size amplification of 2% means that a database that
  // contains 100 bytes of user-data may occupy upto 102 bytes of
  // physical storage. By this definition, a fully compacted database has
  // a size amplification of 0%. Rocksdb uses the following heuristic
  // to calculate size amplification: it assumes that all files excluding
  // the earliest file contribute to the size amplification.
  // Default: 200, which means that a 100 byte database could require upto
  // 300 bytes of storage.

  // size is just above this value. In normal cases, at least this percentage
  // of data will be compressed.
  // When we are compacting to a new file, here is the criteria whether
  // it needs to be compressed: assuming here are the list of files sorted
  // by generation time:
  //    A1...An B1...Bm C1...Ct
  // where A1 is the newest and Ct is the oldest, and we are going to compact
  // B1...Bm, we calculate the total size of all the files as total_size, as
  // well as  the total size of C1...Ct as total_C, the compaction output file
  // will be compressed iff
  //   total_C / total_size < this percentage
