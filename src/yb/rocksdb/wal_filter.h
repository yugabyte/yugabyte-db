  //  * reporting corrupted record
  //    (by returning WalProcessingOption::kCorruptedRecord)

  // @params batch          batch encountered in the log during recovery
  // @params new_batch      new_batch to populate if filter wants to change

  //                        be failed.
  // @params batch_changed  Whether batch was changed by the filter.
  //                        It must be set to true if new_batch was populated,
  //                        else new_batch has no effect.
