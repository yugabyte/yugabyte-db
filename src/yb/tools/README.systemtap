SystemTap
---------

SystemTap is a robust system for tracing kernel and user events.


Requirements
------------
On Ubuntu systems (written against 14.04):
1. Install the 'systemtap' package.
2. Optionally install the 'systemtap-doc' package for some useful manpages
   (like 'stapprobes' and 'stapfuncs').
3. Run stap-prep. It'll probably tell you to do the following:
   a. Install the debug symbols for your kernel. Follow the instructions at
      https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DebuggingProgramCrash#Debug_Symbol_Packages to
      install the right package. It should be named something like
      linux-image-3.13.0-36-generic-dbgsym.
   b. Add yourself to both the 'stapusr' and 'stapdev' groups. This isn't
      strictly required; you can run SystemTap scripts as root.

On RHEL systems (written against CentOS 6.4):
1. Install the 'systemtap' package.
2. Install the debug symbols for your kernel. Follow the instructions at
   http://fendertech.blogspot.com/2013/04/centos-install-kernel-debuginfo.html
   to add the appropriate repo, then install the right package. It should be
   named something like kernel-debuginfo-2.6.32-358.23.2.el6.x86_64.
3. Add yourself to both the 'stapusr' and 'stapdev' groups. This isn't
   strictly required; you can run SystemTap scripts as root.

Running
-------
Some SystemTap scripts have a hashbang so that they can be run directly.
Others need to be run with the 'stap' binary.

Useful options include:
 -o FILE: send standard output to the given file.
 -c CMD: run the command, set the probe target to the command's PID, and exit
         when it finishes. Relevant for scripts that filter on target().
 -x PID: set the probe target to PID. Relevant for scripts that filter on
         target().
