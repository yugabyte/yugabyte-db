// LockManager for acquiring table/object locks of type TableLockType on a given object id.
// TSLocalLockManager uses LockManagerImpl<ObjectLockPrefix> to acheive the locking/unlocking
// behavior, yet the scope of the object lock is not just limited to the scope of the lock rpc
// request. If a lock request is responded with success, the object lock(s) are stored in memory
// at the LockManagerImpl until an explicit Unlock request is issued. In case of failure to lock,
// only the locks acquired so far as part of the same rpc request are released.
//
// TSLocalLockManager is currently used for table locking feature. In brief, all DMLs acquire
// required table/object locks on the local tserver's object lock manager, and all DDLs acquire
// table/object locks on all live tservers.
//
// Note that upon a server crash/restart, all acquired object locks are lost, which is the
// desired behavior for table locks. This is because, all DMLs hosted by the query layer client
// of the corresponding tserver would be aborted, hence we would want to release all object locks
// held by the DMLs. The master leader is responsible for re-acquiring locks corresponding to
// all active DDLs. The same applies on addition of a new tserver node, the master bootstraps
// it with all exisitng DDL (global) locks.

  // Tries acquiring object locks with the specified modes and registers them against the given
  // transaction <<txn, reuse_version>, subtxn>. When locking a batch of keys, if the lock mananger
  // errors while acquiring the lock on the k'th key/record, all acquired locks i.e (1 to k-1) are
  // released and the error is returned back to the client. Note that previous successful locks
  // corresponding to the same txn remain unchanged until an explicit unlock request comes in.
  //
  // Note that the lock manager ignores the transaction's conflict with itself. So a txn can acquire
  // conflicting lock types on a key given that there aren't other txns with active conflciting
  // locks on the key.
  //
  // Continuous influx of readers can starve writers. For instance, if there are multiple txns
  // requesting ACCESS_SHARE on a key, a writer requesting ACCESS_EXCLUSIVE may face starvation.
  // Since we intend to use this for table locks, DDLs may face starvation if there is influx of
  // conflicting DMLs.
  // TODO: DDLs don't face starvation in PG. Address the above starvation problem.
  //
  // TODO: Augment the 'pg_locks' path to show the acquired/waiting object/table level locks.
