// Sanitize a bool value which might be sour.
//
// I made up the term "sour bool".  It means a bool that is not false (0x0)
// and not true (0x1) but has one of the other 2^N-2 states.  A common way
// to create a sour bool is to read an uninitialized bool object.
//
// The Standard says:
// [dcl.init] 8.5 -9- "Otherwise, if no initializer is specified for an
// object, the object and its subobjects, if any, have an indeterminate
// initial value."
// [basic.fundamental] 3.9.1 -5- footnote 42: "Using a bool value in ways
// described by this International standard as "undefined", such as by
// examining the value of an uninitialized automatic variable, might cause
// it to behave as if niether true nor false."
//
// Specifically, this program fragment:
//   bool b;
//   printf("%d\n", b ? 1 : 0);
// can print any value at all, not just 1 or 0!  gcc-4.1.0-piii-linux-opt
// generates code tantamount to "static_cast<int>(b)" with no comparison
// operators.  This is harmful for invalid values of b, but fast for all
// valid values.
//
// The original bug was a sour bool that confused the protobuf runtime.
// RawOutputToArray wrote a single byte with the sour bool value and
// ReadBool read a ReadVarint32.  If the sour bool did not look like a
// single-byte varint32, then the serialized protobuf would be unreadable.
//
// ===
//
// If you run into a compiler where the volatile pointer does not work, try
// a bit_cast.  Just plain "static_cast<unsigned char>(b) ? 1 : 0" does not
// work with gcc-4.1.0-piii-linux-opt, but bit_cast does.
//
// ===
//
// If the assert fires, you probably have an uninitialized bool value.  The
// original case of this was an auto struct with an uninitialized bool
// field.  It might also be memory corruption, or it might be a new C++
// compiler that has found a new way to hurt us.
//
// ===
//
// Props to Apurv Gupta for the report, Ian Lance Taylor for volatile,
// and Sanjay Ghemawat for general guidance.
