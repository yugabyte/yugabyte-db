// The core Jenkins Lookup2-based hashing routines. These are legacy hashing
// routines and should be avoided in new code. Their implementations are dated
// and cannot be changed due to values being recorded and breaking if not
// preserved. New code which explicitly desires this property should use the
// consistent hashing libraries. New code which does not explicitly desire this
// behavior should use the generic hashing routines in hash.h.

//   These are Bob Jenkins' hash functions, one for 32 bit numbers
//   and one for 64 bit numbers.  Each takes a string as input and
//   a start seed.  Hashing the same string with two different seeds
//   should give two independent hash values.
//      The *Num*() functions just do a single mix, in order to
//   convert the given number into something *random*.
//
// Note that these methods may return any value for the given size, while
// the corresponding HashToXX() methods avoids certain reserved values.
