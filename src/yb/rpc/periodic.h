// Repeatedly runs a task on a fixed period.
//
// PeriodicTimer's periodicity is maintained via tail recursive calls to
// Messenger::ScheduleOnReactor(). Every time the scheduled callback is
// invoked, it checks the current time, updates some internal bookkeeping,
// runs the user's task if the time is right, and makes another call to
// Messenger::ScheduleOnReactor() to run itself again in the future. This
// looping behavior is called a "callback loop".
//
// Every time Stop() and then Start() (or just Start(), if this is the first
// such call) are invoked, PeriodicTimer will kick off a new callback loop. If
// there was an old loop, it remains intact until its scheduled callback runs,
// at which point it will detect that a new loop was created and exit.
//
// The use of Messenger::ScheduleOnReactor() is merely for convenience;
// PeriodicTimer could also be built on libev, a hashed wheel timer, or
// something equivalent.
//
// PeriodicTimers have shared ownership, but that's largely an implementation
// detail to support asynchronous stopping. Users can treat them as exclusively
// owned (though care must be taken when writing the task functor; see Stop()
// for more details).
//
// TODO(venkatesh): eventually we should build directly on libev as it supports
// timer cancelation, which would allow us to implement synchronous Stop(), use
// exclusive ownership, and remove the restriction that the delta passed
// into Snooze() be greater than GetMinimumPeriod().
