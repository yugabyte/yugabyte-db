// for another call to avoid extra destruction/construction, see RpcController::Reset.
// The client may use this class prior to sending an RPC in order to set properties such
// as the call's timeout.
//
// After the call has been sent (e.g using Proxy::AsyncRequest()) the user
// may invoke methods on the RpcController object in order to probe the status
