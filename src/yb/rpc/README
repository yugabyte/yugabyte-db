RPC

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intro
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The RPC layer makes communication with remote processes look like local
function calls.  You can make either asynchronous calls, in which you provide a
callback which is invoked later, or synchronous calls, where your thread blocks
until the remote system responds.

The wire format of YugabyteDB RPC is very close to the wire format of Hadoop IPC in
hadoop-3 and beyond. It is not identical since there are still some java-isms
left in Hadoop IPC which we did not want to inherit. In addition, YugabyteDB RPC has
developed some extra features such as deadline propagation which are not
available in Hadoop. However, the overall structure of the wire protocol is
very similar.

We use protocol buffers for serialization, and libev for non-blocking I/O.

For some code examples, look in rpc-test.cc and rpc_stub-test.

Each reactor has a thread which uses epoll to handle many sockets using
non-blocking I/O.  Blocking calls are implemented by the Proxy using
non-blocking calls-- from the point of view of the Messenger, all calls are
non-blocking.

The acceptor pool and the service pool are optional components.  If you don't
expect anyone to be connecting to you, you do not have to start them. If a server
expects to listen on multiple ports (eg for different protocols), multiple
AcceptorPools may be attached.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Proxy classes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proxy classes are used by the client to send calls to a remote service.
Calls may be made synchronously or asynchronously -- the synchronous calls are simply
a wrapper around the asynchronous version, which makes the call and then waits
on the callback to be triggered.

In order to make a call, the user must provide a method name, a request protobuf,
a response protobuf, an RpcController, and a callback.

Each RpcController object corresponds to exactly one in-flight call on the client.
This class is where per-call settings may be adjusted before making an RPC --
currently this is just timeout functionality, but in the future may include
other call properties such as tracing information, priority classes, deadline
propagation, etc.

Upon issuing the asynchronous request, the RPC layer enqueues the call to be sent
to the server and immediately returns. During this period, the caller thread
may continue to send other RPCs or perform other processing while waiting for
the callback to be triggered. In the future, we will provide an RPC cancellation
function on the RpcController object in case the user determines that the call
is no longer required.

When the call completes, the RPC layer will invoke the provided ResponseCallback
function from within the context of the reactor thread. Given this,
ResponseCallbacks should be careful to never block, as it would prevent other
threads from concurrent sending or receiving RPCs.

The callback is invoked exactly one time, regardless of the call's termination state.
The user can determine the call's state by invoking methods on the RpcController object,
for example to determine whether the call succeded, timed out, or suffered a
transport error. In the case that the call succeeds, the user-provided response protobuf
will have been initialized to contain the result.

Please see the accompanying documentation in the Proxy and RpcController classes
for more information on the specific API, as well as the test cases in rpc-test.cc
for example usage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Generated Code
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, clients will use auto-generated subclasses of Proxy and ServiceIf to
get additional type safety and nicer APIs.

The generated proxy object has the same API as the generic Proxy, except that
methods are generated for each RPC defined within the protobuf service. Each
RPC has a synchronous and async version, corresponding to Proxy::AsyncRequest and
Proxy::SyncRequest. These generated methods have an identical API to the generic
one except that they are type-safe and do not require the method name to be passed.

The generated ServiceIf class contains pure virtual methods for each of the RPCs
in the service. Each method to be implemented has an API like:

  void MethodName(const RequestPB *req,
     ResponsePB *resp, ::yb::rpc::RpcContext context);

The request PB is the user-provided request, and the response PB is a cleared
protobuf ready to store the RPC response. Once the RPC response has been filled in,
the service should call context->RespondSuccess(). This method may be called
from any thread in the application at any point either before or after the
actual handler method returns.

In the case of an unexpected error, the generated code may alternatively call
context->RespondFailure(...). However, for any error responses which should be
parseable by the client code, it is preferable to define an error response inside
the response protobuf itself -- this is a much more flexible way of returning
actionable information with an error, given that Status just holds a string
and not much else.

See rpc/rpc-test-base.h for an example service implementation, as well as the
documentation comments in rpc/service_if.h.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ServiceIf classes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ServiceIf classes are abstract interfaces that the server implements to handle
incoming RPCs.  In general, each generated service has several virtual methods
which you can override in order to implement the relevant function call.

There is a ServicePool which you can use to coordinate several worker threads
handling callbacks.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RPC Sidecars
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
RPC sidecars are used to avoid excess copies for large volumes of data.
Prior to RPC sidecars, the sequence of steps for creating an RPC response
on the server side would be as follows:

1. Write the prepared response to a Google protobuf message.
2. Pass the message off to the InboundCall class, which serializes the
   protobuf into a process-local buffer.
3. Copy the process-local buffer to the kernel buffer (send() to a socket).

The client follows these steps in reverse order. On top of the extra copy,
this procedure also forces us to use std::string, which is difficult for
compilers to inline code for and requires that reserved bytes are nulled out,
which is an unnecessary call to memset.

Instead, sidecars provide a mechanism to indicate the need to pass a large
store of data to the InboundCall class, which manages the response to a single
RPC on the server side. When send()-ing the rest of the message (i.e., the
protobuf), the sidecar's data is directly written to the socket.

The data is appended directly after the main message protobuf. Here's what
a typical message looks like without sidecars:

+------------------------------------------------+
| Total message length (4 bytes)                 |
+------------------------------------------------+
| RPC Header protobuf length (variable encoding) |
+------------------------------------------------+
| RPC Header protobuf                            |
+------------------------------------------------+
| Main message length (variable encoding)        |
+------------------------------------------------+
| Main message protobuf                          |
+------------------------------------------------+

In this case, the main message length is equal to the protobuf's byte size.
Since there are no sidecars, the header protobuf's sidecar_offsets list
will will be empty.

Here's what it looks like with the sidecars:

+------------------------------------------------+
| Total message length (4 bytes)                 |
+------------------------------------------------+
| RPC Header protobuf length (variable encoding) |
+------------------------------------------------+
| RPC Header protobuf                            |
+------------------------------------------------+
| Main message length (variable encoding)        |
+------------------------------------------------+ --- 0
| Main message protobuf                          |
+------------------------------------------------+ --- sidecar_offsets(0)
| Sidecar 0                                      |
+------------------------------------------------+ --- sidecar_offsets(1)
| Sidecar 1                                      |
+------------------------------------------------+ --- sidecar_offsets(2)
| Sidecar 2                                      |
+------------------------------------------------+ --- ...
| ...                                            |
+------------------------------------------------+

When there are sidecars, the sidecar_offsets member in the header will be a
nonempty list, whose values indicate the offset, measured from the beginning
of the main message protobuf, of the start of each sidecar. The number
of offsets will indicate the number of sidecars.

Then, on the client side, the sidecars locations are decoded and made available
by RpcController::GetSidecars() (which returns the pointer to the array of all
the sidecars). The caller must be sure to check that the sidecar index in the
sidecar array is correct and in-bounds.

More information is available in rpc/rpc_sidecar.h.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Wire Protocol
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Connection establishment and connection header
----------------------------------------------

After the client connects to a server, the client first sends a connection header.
The connection header consists of a magic number "hrpc" and three byte flags,
for a total of 7 bytes:

+----------------------------------+
|  "hrpc" 4 bytes                  |
+----------------------------------+
|  Version (1 byte)                |
+----------------------------------+
|  ServiceClass (1 byte)           |
+----------------------------------+
|  AuthProtocol (1 byte)           |
+----------------------------------+

Currently, the RPC version is 9. The ServiceClass and AuthProtocol fields are unused.


Message framing and request/response headers
--------------------------------------------
Aside from the initial connection header described above, all other messages are
serialized as follows:

  total_size: (32-bit big-endian integer)
    the size of the rest of the message, not including this 4-byte header

  header: varint-prefixed header protobuf
    - client->server messages use the RequestHeader protobuf
    - server->client messages use the ResponseHeader protobuf

  body: varint-prefixed protobuf
    - for typical RPC calls, this is the user-specified request or response
      protobuf
    - for RPC calls which caused an error, the response is a ErrorResponsePB


Example packet capture
--------------------------
An example call (captured with strace on rpc-test.cc) follows:

   "\x00\x00\x00\x17"   (total_size: 23 bytes to follow)
   "\x09"  RequestHeader varint: 9 bytes
    "\x08\x0a\x1a\x03\x41\x64\x64\x20\x01" (RequestHeader protobuf)
      Decoded with protoc --decode=RequestHeader rpc_header.proto:
      callId: 10
      methodName: "Add"
      requestParam: true

   "\x0c"  Request parameter varint: 12 bytes
    "\x08\xd4\x90\x80\x91\x01\x10\xf8\xcf\xc4\xed\x04" Request parameter
      Decoded with protoc --decode=yb.rpc_test.AddRequestPB rpc/rtest.proto
      x: 304089172
      y: 1303455736


Connection Context:
------------------
Once the SASL negotiation is complete, before the first request, the client
sends the server a special call with call_id -3. The body of this call is a
ConnectionContextPB. The server should not respond to this call.


Steady state
------------
During steady state operation, the client sends call protobufs prefixed by
RequestHeader protobufs. The server sends responses prefixed by ResponseHeader
protobufs.

The client must send calls in strictly increasing 'call_id' order. The server
may reject repeated calls or calls with lower IDs. The server's responses may
arrive out-of-order, and use the 'call_id' in the response to associate a response
with the correct call.
