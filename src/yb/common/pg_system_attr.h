  // After PG11, PG removed WITH OIDS support. This change made oids into normal columns and made a
  // number of changes to sysattr.h. (Constants referenced in this comment are from sysattr.h.) The
  // change removed the special oid system column attribute number of -2. It also renumbered the
  // system attributes [-3,-7] to [-2,-6] to fill the gap. YB had set the value of
  // YBTupleIdAttributeNumber to be equal to PG's FirstLowInvalidHeapAttributeNumber, but that value
  // changed from -8 to -7.
  //
  // During a PG major version upgrade, we require for the two versions of PG to interoperate, so we
  // must preserve -8 as the protocol value for the tuple ID in DocDB for all PG versions.
  // Unfortunately, we can't just naively switch PG code back to using -8 for the YB tuple ID field,
  // because there are many bitmapsets that store negative values starting with
  // FirstLowInvalidHeapAttributeNumber, which is -7. Therefore, internal to PG, it's easiest to use
  // a similar scheme to PG11, where kYBTupleIdAttributeNumber is equal to
  // FirstLowInvalidAttributeNumber, allowing it to work in PG bitmapsets, and then when querying
  // DocDB, we convert it to the protocol value of -8.
  kPGInternalYBTupleId  = -7, // Value of PG's internal representation of YB tuple ID.
  kYBTupleId            = -8, // ybctid: virtual column representing DocDB-encoded key.

                              // Must be -8 in all versions of YB as part of the wire protocol.

  // The following attribute numbers are stored persistently in the table schema. For this reason,
  // they are chosen to avoid potential conflict with Postgres' own sys attributes now and future.
