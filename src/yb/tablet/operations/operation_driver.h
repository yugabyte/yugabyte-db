// Base class for operation drivers.
//
// OperationDriver classes encapsulate the logic of coordinating the execution of an operation. The
// exact triggering of the methods differs based on whether the operation is being executed on a
// leader or replica, but the general flow is:
//
//  1 - Init() is called on a newly created driver object.  If the driver is instantiated from a
//  REPLICA, then we know that the operation is already "REPLICATING" (and thus we don't need to
//  trigger replication ourselves later on).
//
//  2 - ExecuteAsync() is called. This submits the operation driver to the Preparer and returns
//      immediately.
//
//  3 - PrepareAndStartTask() calls Prepare() and Start() on the operation.
//
//      Once successfully prepared, if we have not yet replicated (i.e we are leader), also triggers
//      consensus->Replicate() and changes the replication state to REPLICATING.
//
//      What happens in reality is more complicated, as Preparer tries to batch leader-side
//      operations before submitting them to consensus.
//
//      On the other hand, if we have already successfully replicated (e.g. we are the follower and
//      ConsensusCommitted() has already been called, then we can move on to ApplyOperation().
//
//  4 - The Consensus implementation calls ConsensusCommitted()
//
//      This is triggered by consensus when the commit index moves past our own OpId. On followers,
//      this can happen before Prepare() finishes, and thus we have to check whether we have already
//      done step 3. On leaders, we don't start the consensus round until after Prepare, so this
//      check always passes.
//
//      If Prepare() has already completed, then we trigger ApplyAsync().
//
//  5 - ApplyOperation() calls ApplyTask(), which then calls operation_->Apply().
//
//      When operation_->Apply() is called, changes are made to the in-memory data structures. These
//      changes are not visible to clients yet.
//
//  6 - The driver executes Finalize() which, in turn, makes operations make their changes visible
//      to other operations.  After this step the driver replies to the client if needed and the
//      operation is completed.  In-memory data structures that contain the changes made by the
//      operation can now be made durable.
//
// This class is thread safe.
