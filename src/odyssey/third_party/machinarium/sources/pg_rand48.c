 * erand48.c
 *
 * This file supplies mm_pg_erand48(), mm_pg_lrand48(), and mm_pg_srand48(), which
 * are just like erand48(), lrand48(), and srand48() except that we use
 * our own implementation rather than the one provided by the operating
 * system.  We used to test for an operating system version rather than
 * unconditionally using our own, but (1) some versions of Cygwin have a
 * buggy erand48() that always returns zero and (2) as of 2011, glibc's
 * erand48() is strangely coded to be almost-but-not-quite thread-safe,
 * which doesn't matter for the backend but is important for pgbench.
