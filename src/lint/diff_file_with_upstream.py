# Diff a file with upstream's version of it.
# Input: filepath (with respect to yugabyte/yugabyte-db repository) to run diff for.
# - Exit 0 for successfully getting a diff (regardless of whether there are differences or not).
#   Output the diff to stdout.
# - Exit 1 for exceptions and assertion failures.  For the most part, output the main error message
#   to stdout.  stderr gets the full stack trace that Python naturally provides.
# - Exit 2 when the upstream file or commit is not found.
# If you get exit code 1, you may need to update the list of expected exceptions to be caught.
