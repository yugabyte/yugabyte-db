 * Flags for PGPROC.delayChkpt

 * These flags can be used to delay the start or completion of a checkpoint

 * the PGPROC of any backend.
 *
 * For our purposes here, a checkpoint has three phases: (1) determine the
 * location to which the redo pointer will be moved, (2) write all the
 * data durably to disk, and (3) WAL-log the checkpoint.
 *
 * Setting DELAY_CHKPT_START prevents the system from moving from phase 1
 * to phase 2. This is useful when we are performing a WAL-logged modification
 * of data that will be flushed to disk in phase 2. By setting this flag
 * before writing WAL and clearing it after we've both written WAL and
 * performed the corresponding modification, we ensure that if the WAL record
 * is inserted prior to the new redo point, the corresponding data changes will
 * also be flushed to disk before the checkpoint can complete. (In the
 * extremely common case where the data being modified is in shared buffers
 * and we acquire an exclusive content lock on the relevant buffers before
 * writing WAL, this mechanism is not needed, because phase 2 will block
 * until we release the content lock and then flush the modified data to
 * disk.)
 *
 * Setting DELAY_CHKPT_COMPLETE prevents the system from moving from phase 2
 * to phase 3. This is useful if we are performing a WAL-logged operation that
 * might invalidate buffers, such as relation truncation. In this case, we need
 * to ensure that any buffers which were invalidated and thus not flushed by
 * the checkpoint are actaully destroyed on disk. Replay can cope with a file
 * or block that doesn't exist, but not with a block that has the wrong
 * contents.

/*
 * There is one ProcGlobal struct for the whole database cluster.
 *
 * Adding/Removing an entry into the procarray requires holding *both*
 * ProcArrayLock and XidGenLock in exclusive mode (in that order). Both are
 * needed because the dense arrays (see below) are accessed from
 * GetNewTransactionId() and GetSnapshotData(), and we don't want to add
 * further contention by both using the same lock. Adding/Removing a procarray
 * entry is much less frequent.
 *
 * Some fields in PGPROC are mirrored into more densely packed arrays (e.g.
 * xids), with one entry for each backend. These arrays only contain entries
 * for PGPROCs that have been added to the shared array with ProcArrayAdd()
 * (in contrast to PGPROC array which has unused PGPROCs interspersed).
 *
 * The dense arrays are indexed by PGPROC->pgxactoff. Any concurrent
 * ProcArrayAdd() / ProcArrayRemove() can lead to pgxactoff of a procarray
 * member to change.  Therefore it is only safe to use PGPROC->pgxactoff to
 * access the dense array while holding either ProcArrayLock or XidGenLock.
 *
 * As long as a PGPROC is in the procarray, the mirrored values need to be
 * maintained in both places in a coherent manner.
 *
 * The denser separate arrays are beneficial for three main reasons: First, to
 * allow for as tight loops accessing the data as possible. Second, to prevent
 * updates of frequently changing data (e.g. xmin) from invalidating
 * cachelines also containing less frequently changing data (e.g. xid,
 * statusFlags). Third to condense frequently accessed data into as few
 * cachelines as possible.
 *
 * There are two main reasons to have the data mirrored between these dense
 * arrays and PGPROC. First, as explained above, a PGPROC's array entries can
 * only be accessed with either ProcArrayLock or XidGenLock held, whereas the
 * PGPROC entries do not require that (obviously there may still be locking
 * requirements around the individual field, separate from the concerns
 * here). That is particularly important for a backend to efficiently checks
 * it own values, which it often can safely do without locking.  Second, the
 * PGPROC fields allow to avoid unnecessary accesses and modification to the
 * dense arrays. A backend's own PGPROC is more likely to be in a local cache,
 * whereas the cachelines for the dense array will be modified by other
 * backends (often removing it from the cache for other cores/sockets). At
 * commit/abort time a check of the PGPROC value can avoid accessing/dirtying
 * the corresponding array value.
 *
 * Basically it makes sense to access the PGPROC variable when checking a
 * single backend's data, especially when already looking at the PGPROC for
 * other reasons already.  It makes sense to look at the "dense" arrays if we
 * need to look at many / most entries, because we then benefit from the
 * reduced indirection and better cross-process cache-ability.
 *
 * When entering a PGPROC for 2PC transactions with ProcArrayAdd(), the data
 * in the dense arrays is initialized from the PGPROC while it already holds
 * ProcArrayLock.
