/*
 * We support several types of shared-invalidation messages:
 *	* invalidate a specific tuple in a specific catcache
 *	* invalidate all catcache entries from a given system catalog
 *	* invalidate a relcache entry for a specific logical relation
 *	* invalidate all relcache entries
 *	* invalidate an smgr cache entry for a specific physical relation
 *	* invalidate the mapped-relation mapping for a given database
 *	* invalidate any saved snapshot that might be used to scan a given relation
 * More types could be added if needed.  The message type is identified by
 * the first "int8" field of the message struct.  Zero or positive means a
 * specific-catcache inval message (and also serves as the catcache ID field).
 * Negative values identify the other message types, as per codes below.
 *
 * Catcache inval events are initially driven by detecting tuple inserts,
 * updates and deletions in system catalogs (see CacheInvalidateHeapTuple).
 * An update can generate two inval events, one for the old tuple and one for
 * the new, but this is reduced to one event if the tuple's hash key doesn't
 * change.  Note that the inval events themselves don't actually say whether
 * the tuple is being inserted or deleted.  Also, since we transmit only a
 * hash key, there is a small risk of unnecessary invalidations due to chance
 * matches of hash keys.
 *
 * Note that some system catalogs have multiple caches on them (with different
 * indexes).  On detecting a tuple invalidation in such a catalog, separate
 * catcache inval messages must be generated for each of its caches, since
 * the hash keys will generally be different.
 *
 * Catcache, relcache, and snapshot invalidations are transactional, and so
 * are sent to other backends upon commit.  Internally to the generating
 * backend, they are also processed at CommandCounterIncrement so that later
 * commands in the same transaction see the new state.  The generating backend
 * also has to process them at abort, to flush out any cache state it's loaded
 * from no-longer-valid entries.
 *
 * smgr and relation mapping invalidations are non-transactional: they are
 * sent immediately when the underlying file change is made.
