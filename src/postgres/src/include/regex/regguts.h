/*
 * The color map itself
 *
 * This struct holds both data used only at compile time, and the chr to
 * color mapping information, used at both compile and run time.  The latter
 * is the bulk of the space, so it's not really worth separating out the
 * compile-only portion.
 *
 * Ideally, the mapping data would just be an array of colors indexed by
 * chr codes; but for large character sets that's impractical.  Fortunately,
 * common characters have smaller codes, so we can use a simple array for chr
 * codes up to MAX_SIMPLE_CHR, and do something more complex for codes above
 * that, without much loss of performance.  The "something more complex" is a
 * 2-D array of color entries, where row indexes correspond to individual chrs
 * or chr ranges that have been mentioned in the regex (with row zero
 * representing all other chrs), and column indexes correspond to different
 * sets of locale-dependent character classes such as "isalpha".  The
 * classbits[k] entry is zero if we do not care about the k'th character class
 * in this regex, and otherwise it is the bit to be OR'd into the column index
 * if the character in question is a member of that class.  We find the color
 * of a high-valued chr by identifying which colormaprange it is in to get
 * the row index (use row zero if it's in none of them), identifying which of
 * the interesting cclasses it's in to get the column index, and then indexing
 * into the 2-D hicolormap array.
 *
 * The colormapranges are required to be nonempty, nonoverlapping, and to
 * appear in increasing chr-value order.

/*
 * definitions for compacted NFA
 *
 * The main space savings in a compacted NFA is from making the arcs as small
 * as possible.  We store only the transition color and next-state number for
 * each arc.  The list of out arcs for each state is an array beginning at
 * cnfa.states[statenumber], and terminated by a dummy carc struct with
 * co == COLORLESS.
 *
 * The non-dummy carc structs are of two types: plain arcs and LACON arcs.
 * Plain arcs just store the transition color number as "co".  LACON arcs
 * store the lookaround constraint number plus cnfa.ncolors as "co".  LACON
 * arcs can be distinguished from plain by testing for co >= cnfa.ncolors.
 *
 * Note that in a plain arc, "co" can be RAINBOW; since that's negative,
 * it doesn't break the rule about how to recognize LACON arcs.
 *
 * We have special markings for "trivial" NFAs that can match any string
 * (possibly with limits on the number of characters therein).  In such a
 * case, flags & MATCHALL is set (and HASLACONS can't be set).  Then the
 * fields minmatchall and maxmatchall give the minimum and maximum numbers
 * of characters to match.  For example, ".*" produces minmatchall = 0
 * and maxmatchall = DUPINF, while ".+" produces minmatchall = 1 and
 * maxmatchall = DUPINF.
