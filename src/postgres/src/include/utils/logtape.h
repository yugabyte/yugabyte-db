 * The approach tuplesort.c takes to parallel external sorts is that workers,
 * whose state is almost the same as independent serial sorts, are made to
 * produce a final materialized tape of sorted output in all cases.  This is
 * frozen, just like any case requiring a final materialized tape.  However,
 * there is one difference, which is that freezing will also export an
 * underlying shared fileset BufFile for sharing.  Freezing produces TapeShare
 * metadata for the worker when this happens, which is passed along through
 * shared memory to leader.
 *
 * The leader process can then pass an array of TapeShare metadata (one per
 * worker participant) to LogicalTapeSetCreate(), alongside a handle to a
 * shared fileset, which is sufficient to construct a new logical tapeset that
 * consists of each of the tapes materialized by workers.
 *
 * Note that while logtape.c does create an empty leader tape at the end of the
 * tapeset in the leader case, it can never be written to due to a restriction
 * in the shared buffile infrastructure.
