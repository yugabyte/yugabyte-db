# unused_oids
#    Finds blocks of manually-assignable OIDs that have not already been
#    claimed by previous hackers.  The main use is for finding available
#    OIDs for new internal functions.  The numbers printed are inclusive
#    ranges of unused OIDs.
#
#    Before using a large empty block, make sure you aren't about
#    to take over what was intended as expansion space for something
#    else.
