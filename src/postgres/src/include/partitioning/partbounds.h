/*
 * PartitionBoundInfoData encapsulates a set of partition bounds. It is
 * usually associated with partitioned tables as part of its partition
 * descriptor, but may also be used to represent a virtual partitioned
 * table such as a partitioned joinrel within the planner.
 *
 * A list partition datum that is known to be NULL is never put into the
 * datums array. Instead, it is tracked using the null_index field.
 *
 * In the case of range partitioning, ndatums will typically be far less than
 * 2 * nparts, because a partition's upper bound and the next partition's lower
 * bound are the same in most common cases, and we only store one of them (the
 * upper bound).  In case of hash partitioning, ndatums will be the same as the
 * number of partitions.
 *
 * For range and list partitioned tables, datums is an array of datum-tuples
 * with key->partnatts datums each.  For hash partitioned tables, it is an array
 * of datum-tuples with 2 datums, modulus and remainder, corresponding to a
 * given partition.
 *
 * The datums in datums array are arranged in increasing order as defined by
 * functions qsort_partition_rbound_cmp(), qsort_partition_list_value_cmp() and
 * qsort_partition_hbound_cmp() for range, list and hash partitioned tables
 * respectively. For range and list partitions this simply means that the
 * datums in the datums array are arranged in increasing order as defined by
 * the partition key's operator classes and collations.
 *
 * In the case of list partitioning, the indexes array stores one entry for
 * each datum-array entry, which is the index of the partition that accepts
 * rows matching that datum.  So nindexes == ndatums.
 *
 * In the case of range partitioning, the indexes array stores one entry per
 * distinct range datum, which is the index of the partition for which that
 * datum is an upper bound (or -1 for a "gap" that has no partition).  It is
 * convenient to have an extra -1 entry representing values above the last
 * range datum, so nindexes == ndatums + 1.
 *
 * In the case of hash partitioning, the number of entries in the indexes
 * array is the same as the greatest modulus amongst all partitions (which
 * is a multiple of all partition moduli), so nindexes == greatest modulus.
 * The indexes array is indexed according to the hash key's remainder modulo
 * the greatest modulus, and it contains either the partition index accepting
 * that remainder, or -1 if there is no partition for that remainder.
 *
 * For LIST partitioned tables, we track the partition indexes of partitions
 * which are possibly "interleaved" partitions.  A partition is considered
 * interleaved if it allows multiple values and there exists at least one
 * other partition which could contain a value that lies between those values.
 * For example, if a partition exists FOR VALUES IN(3,5) and another partition
 * exists FOR VALUES IN (4), then the IN(3,5) partition is an interleaved
 * partition.  The same is possible with DEFAULT partitions since they can
 * contain any value that does not belong in another partition.  This field
 * only serves as proof that a particular partition is not interleaved, not
 * proof that it is interleaved.  When we're uncertain, we marked the
 * partition as interleaved.  The interleaved_parts field is only ever set for
 * RELOPT_BASEREL and RELOPT_OTHER_MEMBER_REL, it is always left NULL for join
 * relations.
