 *	BTPageOpaqueData -- At the end of every page, we store a pointer
 *	to both siblings in the tree.  This is used to do forward/backward
 *	index scans.  The next-page link is also critical for recovery when
 *	a search has navigated to the wrong page due to concurrent page splits
 *	or deletions; see src/backend/access/nbtree/README for more info.
 *
 *	In addition, we store the page's btree level (counting upwards from
 *	zero at a leaf page) as well as some flag bits indicating the page type
 *	and status.  If the page is deleted, a BTDeletedPageData struct is stored
 *	in the page's tuple area, while a standard BTPageOpaqueData struct is
 *	stored in the page special area.
 *
 *	We also store a "vacuum cycle ID".  When a page is split while VACUUM is
 *	processing the index, a nonzero value associated with the VACUUM run is
 *	stored into both halves of the split page.  (If VACUUM is not running,
 *	both pages receive zero cycleids.)	This allows VACUUM to detect whether
 *	a page was split since it started, with a small probability of false match
 *	if the page was last split some exact multiple of MAX_BT_CYCLE_ID VACUUMs
 *	ago.  Also, during a split, the BTP_SPLIT_END flag is cleared in the left
 *	(original) page, and set in the right page, but only if the next page
 *	to its right has a different cycleid.
 *
 *	NOTE: the BTP_LEAF flag bit is redundant since level==0 could be tested
 *	instead.
 *
 *	NOTE: the btpo_level field used to be a union type in order to allow
 *	deleted pages to store a 32-bit safexid in the same field.  We now store
 *	64-bit/full safexid values using BTDeletedPageData instead.

 * Notes on B-Tree tuple format, and key and non-key attributes:
 *
 * INCLUDE B-Tree indexes have non-key attributes.  These are extra
 * attributes that may be returned by index-only scans, but do not influence
 * the order of items in the index (formally, non-key attributes are not
 * considered to be part of the key space).  Non-key attributes are only
 * present in leaf index tuples whose item pointers actually point to heap
 * tuples (non-pivot tuples).  _bt_check_natts() enforces the rules
 * described here.
 *
 * Non-pivot tuple format (plain/non-posting variant):
 *
 *  t_tid | t_info | key values | INCLUDE columns, if any
 *
 * t_tid points to the heap TID, which is a tiebreaker key column as of
 * BTREE_VERSION 4.
 *
 * Non-pivot tuples complement pivot tuples, which only have key columns.
 * The sole purpose of pivot tuples is to represent how the key space is
 * separated.  In general, any B-Tree index that has more than one level
 * (i.e. any index that does not just consist of a metapage and a single
 * leaf root page) must have some number of pivot tuples, since pivot
 * tuples are used for traversing the tree.  Suffix truncation can omit
 * trailing key columns when a new pivot is formed, which makes minus
 * infinity their logical value.  Since BTREE_VERSION 4 indexes treat heap
 * TID as a trailing key column that ensures that all index tuples are
 * physically unique, it is necessary to represent heap TID as a trailing
 * key column in pivot tuples, though very often this can be truncated
 * away, just like any other key column. (Actually, the heap TID is
 * omitted rather than truncated, since its representation is different to
 * the non-pivot representation.)
 *
 * Pivot tuple format:
 *
 *  t_tid | t_info | key values | [heap TID]
 *
 * We store the number of columns present inside pivot tuples by abusing
 * their t_tid offset field, since pivot tuples never need to store a real
 * offset (pivot tuples generally store a downlink in t_tid, though).  The
 * offset field only stores the number of columns/attributes when the
 * INDEX_ALT_TID_MASK bit is set, which doesn't count the trailing heap
 * TID column sometimes stored in pivot tuples -- that's represented by
 * the presence of BT_PIVOT_HEAP_TID_ATTR.  The INDEX_ALT_TID_MASK bit in
 * t_info is always set on BTREE_VERSION 4 pivot tuples, since
 * BTreeTupleIsPivot() must work reliably on heapkeyspace versions.
 *
 * In version 2 or version 3 (!heapkeyspace) indexes, INDEX_ALT_TID_MASK
 * might not be set in pivot tuples.  BTreeTupleIsPivot() won't work
 * reliably as a result.  The number of columns stored is implicitly the
 * same as the number of columns in the index, just like any non-pivot
 * tuple. (The number of columns stored should not vary, since suffix
 * truncation of key columns is unsafe within any !heapkeyspace index.)
 *
 * The 12 least significant bits from t_tid's offset number are used to
 * represent the number of key columns within a pivot tuple.  This leaves 4
 * status bits (BT_STATUS_OFFSET_MASK bits), which are shared by all tuples
 * that have the INDEX_ALT_TID_MASK bit set (set in t_info) to store basic
 * tuple metadata.  BTreeTupleIsPivot() and BTreeTupleIsPosting() use the
 * BT_STATUS_OFFSET_MASK bits.
 *
 * Sometimes non-pivot tuples also use a representation that repurposes
 * t_tid to store metadata rather than a TID.  PostgreSQL v13 introduced a
 * new non-pivot tuple format to support deduplication: posting list
 * tuples.  Deduplication merges together multiple equal non-pivot tuples
 * into a logically equivalent, space efficient representation.  A posting
 * list is an array of ItemPointerData elements.  Non-pivot tuples are
 * merged together to form posting list tuples lazily, at the point where
 * we'd otherwise have to split a leaf page.
 *
 * Posting tuple format (alternative non-pivot tuple representation):
 *
 *  t_tid | t_info | key values | posting list (TID array)
 *
 * Posting list tuples are recognized as such by having the
 * INDEX_ALT_TID_MASK status bit set in t_info and the BT_IS_POSTING status
 * bit set in t_tid's offset number.  These flags redefine the content of
 * the posting tuple's t_tid to store the location of the posting list
 * (instead of a block number), as well as the total number of heap TIDs
 * present in the tuple (instead of a real offset number).
 *
 * The 12 least significant bits from t_tid's offset number are used to
 * represent the number of heap TIDs present in the tuple, leaving 4 status
 * bits (the BT_STATUS_OFFSET_MASK bits).  Like any non-pivot tuple, the
 * number of columns stored is always implicitly the total number in the
 * index (in practice there can never be non-key columns stored, since
 * deduplication is not supported with INCLUDE indexes).

 * BTScanInsertData is the btree-private state needed to find an initial
 * position for an indexscan, or to insert new tuples -- an "insertion
 * scankey" (not to be confused with a search scankey).  It's used to descend
 * a B-Tree using _bt_search.
 *
 * heapkeyspace indicates if we expect all keys in the index to be physically
 * unique because heap TID is used as a tiebreaker attribute, and if index may
 * have truncated key attributes in pivot tuples.  This is actually a property
 * of the index relation itself (not an indexscan).  heapkeyspace indexes are
 * indexes whose version is >= version 4.  It's convenient to keep this close
 * by, rather than accessing the metapage repeatedly.
 *
 * allequalimage is set to indicate that deduplication is safe for the index.
 * This is also a property of the index relation rather than an indexscan.
 *
 * anynullkeys indicates if any of the keys had NULL value when scankey was
 * built from index tuple (note that already-truncated tuple key attributes
 * set NULL as a placeholder key value, which also affects value of
 * anynullkeys).  This is a convenience for unique index non-pivot tuple
 * insertion, which usually temporarily unsets scantid, but shouldn't iff
 * anynullkeys is true.  Value generally matches non-pivot tuple's HasNulls
 * bit, but may not when inserting into an INCLUDE index (tuple header value
 * is affected by the NULL-ness of both key and non-key attributes).
 *
 * When nextkey is false (the usual case), _bt_search and _bt_binsrch will
 * locate the first item >= scankey.  When nextkey is true, they will locate
 * the first item > scan key.
 *
 * pivotsearch is set to true by callers that want to re-find a leaf page
 * using a scankey built from a leaf page's high key.  Most callers set this
 * to false.
 *
 * scantid is the heap TID that is used as a final tiebreaker attribute.  It
 * is set to NULL when index scan doesn't need to find a position for a
 * specific physical tuple.  Must be set when inserting new tuples into
 * heapkeyspace indexes, since every tuple in the tree unambiguously belongs
 * in one exact position (it's never set with !heapkeyspace indexes, though).
 * Despite the representational difference, nbtree search code considers
 * scantid to be just another insertion scankey attribute.
 *
 * scankeys is an array of scan key entries for attributes that are compared
 * before scantid (user-visible attributes).  keysz is the size of the array.
 * During insertion, there must be a scan key for every attribute, but when
 * starting a regular index scan some can be omitted.  The array is used as a
 * flexible array member, though it's sized in a way that makes it possible to
 * use stack allocations.  See nbtree/README for full details.
