/*
 * The parallel scan state structure
 * Most important data stored in the structure is the buffer of parallel key,
 * representing bounds of the blocks to scan by the parallel workers.
 * The keys are ordered, and parallel workers take one at a time in their
 * order as the lower bound of the scan range, and peek at the next key to use
 * as the higher bound. The key is essentially a byte array of variable length,
 * its actual length is stored as the prefixes to the actual data. The keys are
 * stored without gaps, so the end of the key is the beginning of the next. Keys
 * are stored continuously, so if the next key does not fit into the space
 * between the end of the last key and the end of the buffer, it is written from
 * the beginning of the buffer (referred as buffer wraparound).
 *
 * The low_offset and high_offset indicate two "active" keys in the buffer. The
 * low_offset is the key to be used and removed by the worker, grabbing next
 * scan range, and the high_offset points to key used by fetching worker: it is
 * the lower bound when making a request, and the point to append keys from the
 * response. In fact, the keys in the buffer form a FIFO queue. As it was
 * mentioned above, there may be unused space at the end of the buffer, because
 * of the key continuity. The key_data_size variable points to the beginning of
 * that space.
 *
 * The keys are fetched from the DocDB by a random worker when number of the
 * keys available in the buffer goes low. The fetch_status indicates current
 * fetch state. The last key in the buffer (highest key) is used as a fetch
 * starting point. For that reason we do not allow to take the last remaining
 * key from the buffer, until DocDB fetch is done.
 *
 * Purpose of other fields of the structure:
 *  - mutex to synchronize access to other fields
 *  - cv_empty is the conditional variable to wait while buffer has keys
 *    available to take
 *  - total_key_size, total_key_count key stats, also used to estimate number
 *    of keys to fetch (provides average key length).
