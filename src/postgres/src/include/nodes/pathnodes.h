/*----------
 * RelOptInfo
 *		Per-relation information for planning/optimization
 *
 * For planning purposes, a "base rel" is either a plain relation (a table)
 * or the output of a sub-SELECT or function that appears in the range table.
 * In either case it is uniquely identified by an RT index.  A "joinrel"
 * is the joining of two or more base rels.  A joinrel is identified by
 * the set of RT indexes for its component baserels.  We create RelOptInfo
 * nodes for each baserel and joinrel, and store them in the PlannerInfo's
 * simple_rel_array and join_rel_list respectively.
 *
 * Note that there is only one joinrel for any given set of component
 * baserels, no matter what order we assemble them in; so an unordered
 * set is the right datatype to identify it with.
 *
 * We also have "other rels", which are like base rels in that they refer to
 * single RT indexes; but they are not part of the join tree, and are given
 * a different RelOptKind to identify them.
 * Currently the only kind of otherrels are those made for member relations
 * of an "append relation", that is an inheritance set or UNION ALL subquery.
 * An append relation has a parent RTE that is a base rel, which represents
 * the entire append relation.  The member RTEs are otherrels.  The parent
 * is present in the query join tree but the members are not.  The member
 * RTEs and otherrels are used to plan the scans of the individual tables or
 * subqueries of the append set; then the parent baserel is given Append
 * and/or MergeAppend paths comprising the best paths for the individual
 * member rels.  (See comments for AppendRelInfo for more information.)
 *
 * At one time we also made otherrels to represent join RTEs, for use in
 * handling join alias Vars.  Currently this is not needed because all join
 * alias Vars are expanded to non-aliased form during preprocess_expression.
 *
 * We also have relations representing joins between child relations of
 * different partitioned tables. These relations are not added to
 * join_rel_level lists as they are not joined directly by the dynamic
 * programming algorithm.
 *
 * There is also a RelOptKind for "upper" relations, which are RelOptInfos
 * that describe post-scan/join processing steps, such as aggregation.
 * Many of the fields in these RelOptInfos are meaningless, but their Path
 * fields always hold Paths showing ways to do that processing step.
 *
 * Lastly, there is a RelOptKind for "dead" relations, which are base rels
 * that we have proven we don't need to join after all.
 *
 * Parts of this data structure are specific to various scan and join
 * mechanisms.  It didn't seem worth creating new node types for them.
 *
 *		relids - Set of base-relation identifiers; it is a base relation
 *				if there is just one, a join relation if more than one
 *		rows - estimated number of tuples in the relation after restriction
 *			   clauses have been applied (ie, output rows of a plan for it)
 *		consider_startup - true if there is any value in keeping plain paths for
 *						   this rel on the basis of having cheap startup cost
 *		consider_param_startup - the same for parameterized paths
 *		reltarget - Default Path output tlist for this rel; normally contains
 *					Var and PlaceHolderVar nodes for the values we need to
 *					output from this relation.
 *					List is in no particular order, but all rels of an
 *					appendrel set must use corresponding orders.
 *					NOTE: in an appendrel child relation, may contain
 *					arbitrary expressions pulled up from a subquery!
 *		pathlist - List of Path nodes, one for each potentially useful
 *				   method of generating the relation
 *		ppilist - ParamPathInfo nodes for parameterized Paths, if any
 *		cheapest_startup_path - the pathlist member with lowest startup cost
 *			(regardless of ordering) among the unparameterized paths;
 *			or NULL if there is no unparameterized path
 *		cheapest_total_path - the pathlist member with lowest total cost
 *			(regardless of ordering) among the unparameterized paths;
 *			or if there is no unparameterized path, the path with lowest
 *			total cost among the paths with minimum parameterization
 *		cheapest_unique_path - for caching cheapest path to produce unique
 *			(no duplicates) output from relation; NULL if not yet requested
 *		cheapest_parameterized_paths - best paths for their parameterizations;
 *			always includes cheapest_total_path, even if that's unparameterized
 *		direct_lateral_relids - rels this rel has direct LATERAL references to
 *		lateral_relids - required outer rels for LATERAL, as a Relids set
 *			(includes both direct and indirect lateral references)
 *
 * If the relation is a base relation it will have these fields set:
 *
 *		relid - RTE index (this is redundant with the relids field, but
 *				is provided for convenience of access)
 *		rtekind - copy of RTE's rtekind field
 *		min_attr, max_attr - range of valid AttrNumbers for rel
 *		attr_needed - array of bitmapsets indicating the highest joinrel
 *				in which each attribute is needed; if bit 0 is set then
 *				the attribute is needed as part of final targetlist
 *		attr_widths - cache space for per-attribute width estimates;
 *					  zero means not computed yet
 *		lateral_vars - lateral cross-references of rel, if any (list of
 *					   Vars and PlaceHolderVars)
 *		lateral_referencers - relids of rels that reference this one laterally
 *				(includes both direct and indirect lateral references)
 *		indexlist - list of IndexOptInfo nodes for relation's indexes
 *					(always NIL if it's not a table)
 *		pages - number of disk pages in relation (zero if not a table)
 *		tuples - number of tuples in relation (not considering restrictions)
 *		allvisfrac - fraction of disk pages that are marked all-visible
 *		eclass_indexes - EquivalenceClasses that mention this rel (filled
 *						 only after EC merging is complete)
 *		subroot - PlannerInfo for subquery (NULL if it's not a subquery)
 *		subplan_params - list of PlannerParamItems to be passed to subquery
 *
 *		Note: for a subquery, tuples and subroot are not set immediately
 *		upon creation of the RelOptInfo object; they are filled in when
 *		set_subquery_pathlist processes the object.
 *
 *		For otherrels that are appendrel members, these fields are filled
 *		in just as for a baserel, except we don't bother with lateral_vars.
 *
 * If the relation is either a foreign table or a join of foreign tables that
 * all belong to the same foreign server and are assigned to the same user to
 * check access permissions as (cf checkAsUser), these fields will be set:
 *
 *		serverid - OID of foreign server, if foreign table (else InvalidOid)
 *		userid - OID of user to check access as (InvalidOid means current user)
 *		useridiscurrent - we've assumed that userid equals current user
 *		fdwroutine - function hooks for FDW, if foreign table (else NULL)
 *		fdw_private - private state for FDW, if foreign table (else NULL)
 *
 * Two fields are used to cache knowledge acquired during the join search
 * about whether this rel is provably unique when being joined to given other
 * relation(s), ie, it can have at most one row matching any given row from
 * that join relation.  Currently we only attempt such proofs, and thus only
 * populate these fields, for base rels; but someday they might be used for
 * join rels too:
 *
 *		unique_for_rels - list of Relid sets, each one being a set of other
 *					rels for which this one has been proven unique
 *		non_unique_for_rels - list of Relid sets, each one being a set of
 *					other rels for which we have tried and failed to prove
 *					this one unique
 *
 * The presence of the following fields depends on the restrictions
 * and joins that the relation participates in:
 *
 *		baserestrictinfo - List of RestrictInfo nodes, containing info about
 *					each non-join qualification clause in which this relation
 *					participates (only used for base rels)
 *		baserestrictcost - Estimated cost of evaluating the baserestrictinfo
 *					clauses at a single tuple (only used for base rels)
 *		baserestrict_min_security - Smallest security_level found among
 *					clauses in baserestrictinfo
 *		joininfo  - List of RestrictInfo nodes, containing info about each
 *					join clause in which this relation participates (but
 *					note this excludes clauses that might be derivable from
 *					EquivalenceClasses)
 *		has_eclass_joins - flag that EquivalenceClass joins are possible
 *
 * Note: Keeping a restrictinfo list in the RelOptInfo is useful only for
 * base rels, because for a join rel the set of clauses that are treated as
 * restrict clauses varies depending on which sub-relations we choose to join.
 * (For example, in a 3-base-rel join, a clause relating rels 1 and 2 must be
 * treated as a restrictclause if we join {1} and {2 3} to make {1 2 3}; but
 * if we join {1 2} and {3} then that clause will be a restrictclause in {1 2}
 * and should not be processed again at the level of {1 2 3}.)	Therefore,
 * the restrictinfo list in the join case appears in individual JoinPaths
 * (field joinrestrictinfo), not in the parent relation.  But it's OK for
 * the RelOptInfo to store the joininfo list, because that is the same
 * for a given rel no matter how we form it.
 *
 * We store baserestrictcost in the RelOptInfo (for base relations) because
 * we know we will need it at least once (to price the sequential scan)
 * and may need it multiple times to price index scans.
 *
 * A join relation is considered to be partitioned if it is formed from a
 * join of two relations that are partitioned, have matching partitioning
 * schemes, and are joined on an equijoin of the partitioning columns.
 * Under those conditions we can consider the join relation to be partitioned
 * by either relation's partitioning keys, though some care is needed if
 * either relation can be forced to null by outer-joining.  For example, an
 * outer join like (A LEFT JOIN B ON A.a = B.b) may produce rows with B.b
 * NULL.  These rows may not fit the partitioning conditions imposed on B.
 * Hence, strictly speaking, the join is not partitioned by B.b and thus
 * partition keys of an outer join should include partition key expressions
 * from the non-nullable side only.  However, if a subsequent join uses
 * strict comparison operators (and all commonly-used equijoin operators are
 * strict), the presence of nulls doesn't cause a problem: such rows couldn't

 *
 * If the relation is partitioned, these fields will be set:
 *
 *		part_scheme - Partitioning scheme of the relation
 *		nparts - Number of partitions
 *		boundinfo - Partition bounds
 *		partbounds_merged - true if partition bounds are merged ones
 *		partition_qual - Partition constraint if not the root
 *		part_rels - RelOptInfos for each partition
 *		all_partrels - Relids set of all partition relids
 *		partexprs, nullable_partexprs - Partition key expressions
 *
 * The partexprs and nullable_partexprs arrays each contain
 * part_scheme->partnatts elements.  Each of the elements is a list of
 * partition key expressions.  For partitioned base relations, there is one
 * expression in each partexprs element, and nullable_partexprs is empty.
 * For partitioned join relations, each base relation within the join
 * contributes one partition key expression per partitioning column;
 * that expression goes in the partexprs[i] list if the base relation
 * is not nullable by this join or any lower outer join, or in the
 * nullable_partexprs[i] list if the base relation is nullable.
 * Furthermore, FULL JOINs add extra nullable_partexprs expressions
 * corresponding to COALESCE expressions of the left and right join columns,
 * to simplify matching join clauses to those lists.

 * EquivalenceClasses
 *

 * equivalence B = C, we add C to the existing EquivalenceClass; this may
 * require merging two existing EquivalenceClasses.  At the end of the qual
 * distribution process, we have sets of values that are known all transitively
 * equal to each other, where "equal" is according to the rules of the btree
 * operator family(s) shown in ec_opfamilies, as well as the collation shown
 * by ec_collation.  (We restrict an EC to contain only equalities whose
 * operators belong to the same set of opfamilies.  This could probably be
 * relaxed, but for now it's not worth the trouble, since nearly all equality
 * operators belong to only one btree opclass anyway.  Similarly, we suppose
 * that all or none of the input datatypes are collatable, so that a single
 * collation value is sufficient.)
 *
 * We also use EquivalenceClasses as the base structure for PathKeys, letting
 * us represent knowledge about different sort orderings being equivalent.
 * Since every PathKey must reference an EquivalenceClass, we will end up
 * with single-member EquivalenceClasses whenever a sort key expression has
 * not been equivalenced to anything else.  It is also possible that such an
 * EquivalenceClass will contain a volatile expression ("ORDER BY random()"),
 * which is a case that can't arise otherwise since clauses containing
 * volatile functions are never considered mergejoinable.  We mark such
 * EquivalenceClasses specially to prevent them from being merged with
 * ordinary EquivalenceClasses.  Also, for volatile expressions we have
 * to be careful to match the EquivalenceClass to the correct targetlist
 * entry: consider SELECT random() AS a, random() AS b ... ORDER BY b,a.
 * So we record the SortGroupRef of the originating sort clause.
 *
 * We allow equality clauses appearing below the nullable side of an outer join
 * to form EquivalenceClasses, but these have a slightly different meaning:
 * the included values might be all NULL rather than all the same non-null
 * values.  See src/backend/optimizer/README for more on that point.
 *
 * NB: if ec_merged isn't NULL, this class has been merged into another, and

 * 'indexinfo' is the index to be scanned.
 *
 * 'indexclauses' is a list of IndexClause nodes, each representing one
 * index-checkable restriction, with implicit AND semantics across the list.
 * An empty list implies a full index scan.
 *
 * 'yb_bitmap_idx_pushdowns' is a set of pushable clauses for a bitmap index scan.
 * These are extracted during bitmap planning and allow pushdowns that are not
 * possible to determine at a later stage.
 *
 * 'indexorderbys', if not NIL, is a list of ORDER BY expressions that have
 * been found to be usable as ordering operators for an amcanorderbyop index.
 * The list must match the path's pathkeys, ie, one expression per pathkey
 * in the same order.  These are not RestrictInfos, just bare expressions,
 * since they generally won't yield booleans.  It's guaranteed that each
 * expression has the index key on the left side of the operator.
 *
 * 'indexorderbycols' is an integer list of index column numbers (zero-based)
 * of the same length as 'indexorderbys', showing which index column each
 * ORDER BY expression is meant to be used with.  (There is no restriction
 * on which index column each ORDER BY can be used with.)

 *		ForwardScanDirection: forward scan of an ordered index
 *		BackwardScanDirection: backward scan of an ordered index
 *		NoMovementScanDirection: scan of an unordered index, or don't care
 * (The executor doesn't care whether it gets ForwardScanDirection or
 * NoMovementScanDirection for an indexscan, but the planner wants to
 * distinguish ordered from unordered indexes for building pathkeys.)
 *
 * 'indextotalcost' and 'indexselectivity' are saved in the IndexPath so that
 * we need not recompute them when considering using the same index in a
 * bitmap index/heap scan (see BitmapHeapPath / YbBitmapTableScan).  The costs
 * of the IndexPath itself represent the costs of an IndexScan or IndexOnlyScan

/*
 * Restriction clause info.
 *
 * We create one of these for each AND sub-clause of a restriction condition
 * (WHERE or JOIN/ON clause).  Since the restriction clauses are logically
 * ANDed, we can use any one of them or any subset of them to filter out
 * tuples, without having to evaluate the rest.  The RestrictInfo node itself
 * stores data used by the optimizer while choosing the best query plan.
 *
 * If a restriction clause references a single base relation, it will appear
 * in the baserestrictinfo list of the RelOptInfo for that base rel.
 *
 * If a restriction clause references more than one base rel, it will
 * appear in the joininfo list of every RelOptInfo that describes a strict
 * subset of the base rels mentioned in the clause.  The joininfo lists are
 * used to drive join tree building by selecting plausible join candidates.
 * The clause cannot actually be applied until we have built a join rel
 * containing all the base rels it references, however.
 *
 * When we construct a join rel that includes all the base rels referenced
 * in a multi-relation restriction clause, we place that clause into the
 * joinrestrictinfo lists of paths for the join rel, if neither left nor
 * right sub-path includes all base rels referenced in the clause.  The clause
 * will be applied at that join level, and will not propagate any further up
 * the join tree.  (Note: the "predicate migration" code was once intended to
 * push restriction clauses up and down the plan tree based on evaluation
 * costs, but it's dead code and is unlikely to be resurrected in the
 * foreseeable future.)
 *
 * Note that in the presence of more than two rels, a multi-rel restriction
 * might reach different heights in the join tree depending on the join
 * sequence we use.  So, these clauses cannot be associated directly with
 * the join RelOptInfo, but must be kept track of on a per-join-path basis.
 *
 * RestrictInfos that represent equivalence conditions (i.e., mergejoinable
 * equalities that are not outerjoin-delayed) are handled a bit differently.
 * Initially we attach them to the EquivalenceClasses that are derived from
 * them.  When we construct a scan or join path, we look through all the
 * EquivalenceClasses and generate derived RestrictInfos representing the
 * minimal set of conditions that need to be checked for this particular scan
 * or join to enforce that all members of each EquivalenceClass are in fact
 * equal in all rows emitted by the scan or join.
 *
 * When dealing with outer joins we have to be very careful about pushing qual
 * clauses up and down the tree.  An outer join's own JOIN/ON conditions must
 * be evaluated exactly at that join node, unless they are "degenerate"
 * conditions that reference only Vars from the nullable side of the join.
 * Quals appearing in WHERE or in a JOIN above the outer join cannot be pushed
 * down below the outer join, if they reference any nullable Vars.
 * RestrictInfo nodes contain a flag to indicate whether a qual has been
 * pushed down to a lower level than its original syntactic placement in the
 * join tree would suggest.  If an outer join prevents us from pushing a qual
 * down to its "natural" semantic level (the level associated with just the
 * base rels used in the qual) then we mark the qual with a "required_relids"
 * value including more than just the base rels it actually uses.  By
 * pretending that the qual references all the rels required to form the outer
 * join, we prevent it from being evaluated below the outer join's joinrel.
 * When we do form the outer join's joinrel, we still need to distinguish
 * those quals that are actually in that join's JOIN/ON condition from those
 * that appeared elsewhere in the tree and were pushed down to the join rel
 * because they used no other rels.  That's what the is_pushed_down flag is
 * for; it tells us that a qual is not an OUTER JOIN qual for the set of base
 * rels listed in required_relids.  A clause that originally came from WHERE
 * or an INNER JOIN condition will *always* have its is_pushed_down flag set.
 * It's possible for an OUTER JOIN clause to be marked is_pushed_down too,
 * if we decide that it can be pushed down into the nullable side of the join.
 * In that case it acts as a plain filter qual for wherever it gets evaluated.
 * (In short, is_pushed_down is only false for non-degenerate outer join
 * conditions.  Possibly we should rename it to reflect that meaning?  But
 * see also the comments for RINFO_IS_PUSHED_DOWN, below.)
 *
 * RestrictInfo nodes also contain an outerjoin_delayed flag, which is true
 * if the clause's applicability must be delayed due to any outer joins
 * appearing below it (ie, it has to be postponed to some join level higher
 * than the set of relations it actually references).
 *
 * There is also an outer_relids field, which is NULL except for outer join
 * clauses; for those, it is the set of relids on the outer side of the
 * clause's outer join.  (These are rels that the clause cannot be applied to
 * in parameterized scans, since pushing it into the join's outer side would
 * lead to wrong answers.)
 *
 * There is also a nullable_relids field, which is the set of rels the clause
 * references that can be forced null by some outer join below the clause.
 *
 * outerjoin_delayed = true is subtly different from nullable_relids != NULL:
 * a clause might reference some nullable rels and yet not be
 * outerjoin_delayed because it also references all the other rels of the
 * outer join(s). A clause that is not outerjoin_delayed can be enforced
 * anywhere it is computable.
 *
 * To handle security-barrier conditions efficiently, we mark RestrictInfo
 * nodes with a security_level field, in which higher values identify clauses
 * coming from less-trusted sources.  The exact semantics are that a clause
 * cannot be evaluated before another clause with a lower security_level value
 * unless the first clause is leakproof.  As with outer-join clauses, this
 * creates a reason for clauses to sometimes need to be evaluated higher in
 * the join tree than their contents would suggest; and even at a single plan
 * node, this rule constrains the order of application of clauses.
 *
 * In general, the referenced clause might be arbitrarily complex.  The
 * kinds of clauses we can handle as indexscan quals, mergejoin clauses,
 * or hashjoin clauses are limited (e.g., no volatile functions).  The code
 * for each kind of path is responsible for identifying the restrict clauses
 * it can use and ignoring the rest.  Clauses not implemented by an indexscan,
 * mergejoin, or hashjoin will be placed in the plan qual or joinqual field
 * of the finished Plan node, where they will be enforced by general-purpose
 * qual-expression-evaluation code.  (But we are still entitled to count
 * their selectivity when estimating the result tuple count, if we
 * can guess what it is...)
 *
 * When the referenced clause is an OR clause, we generate a modified copy
 * in which additional RestrictInfo nodes are inserted below the top-level
 * OR/AND structure.  This is a convenience for OR indexscan processing:
 * indexquals taken from either the top level or an OR subclause will have
 * associated RestrictInfo nodes.
 *
 * The can_join flag is set true if the clause looks potentially useful as
 * a merge or hash join clause, that is if it is a binary opclause with
 * nonoverlapping sets of relids referenced in the left and right sides.
 * (Whether the operator is actually merge or hash joinable isn't checked,
 * however.)
 *
 * The pseudoconstant flag is set true if the clause contains no Vars of
 * the current query level and no volatile functions.  Such a clause can be
 * pulled out and used as a one-time qual in a gating Result node.  We keep
 * pseudoconstant clauses in the same lists as other RestrictInfos so that
 * the regular clause-pushing machinery can assign them to the correct join
 * level, but they need to be treated specially for cost and selectivity
 * estimates.  Note that a pseudoconstant clause can never be an indexqual
 * or merge or hash join clause, so it's of no interest to large parts of
 * the planner.
 *
 * When join clauses are generated from EquivalenceClasses, there may be
 * several equally valid ways to enforce join equivalence, of which we need
 * apply only one.  We mark clauses of this kind by setting parent_ec to
 * point to the generating EquivalenceClass.  Multiple clauses with the same
 * parent_ec in the same join are redundant.

 * "Special join" info.
 *
 * One-sided outer joins constrain the order of joining partially but not

 * relations to join, but record information about each outer join in a
 * SpecialJoinInfo struct.  These structs are kept in the PlannerInfo node's
 * join_info_list.
 *
 * Similarly, semijoins and antijoins created by flattening IN (subselect)
 * and EXISTS(subselect) clauses create partial constraints on join order.
 * These are likewise recorded in SpecialJoinInfo structs.
 *
 * We make SpecialJoinInfos for FULL JOINs even though there is no flexibility
 * of planning for them, because this simplifies make_join_rel()'s API.
 *
 * min_lefthand and min_righthand are the sets of base relids that must be
 * available on each side when performing the special join.  lhs_strict is
 * true if the special join's condition cannot succeed when the LHS variables
 * are all NULL (this means that an outer join can commute with upper-level
 * outer joins even if it appears in their RHS).  We don't bother to set
 * lhs_strict for FULL JOINs, however.
 *
 * It is not valid for either min_lefthand or min_righthand to be empty sets;
 * if they were, this would break the logic that enforces join order.
 *
 * syn_lefthand and syn_righthand are the sets of base relids that are
 * syntactically below this special join.  (These are needed to help compute
 * min_lefthand and min_righthand for higher joins.)
 *
 * delay_upper_joins is set true if we detect a pushed-down clause that has
 * to be evaluated after this join is formed (because it references the RHS).
 * Any outer joins that have such a clause and this join in their RHS cannot
 * commute with this join, because that would leave noplace to check the
 * pushed-down clause.  (We don't track this for FULL JOINs, either.)
 *
 * For a semijoin, we also extract the join operators and their RHS arguments
 * and set semi_operators, semi_rhs_exprs, semi_can_btree, and semi_can_hash.
 * This is done in support of possibly unique-ifying the RHS, so we don't
 * bother unless at least one of semi_can_btree and semi_can_hash can be set
 * true.  (You might expect that this information would be computed during
 * join planning; but it's helpful to have it available during planning of
 * parameterized table scans, so we store it in the SpecialJoinInfo structs.)
 *
 * jointype is never JOIN_RIGHT; a RIGHT JOIN is handled by switching
 * the inputs to make it a LEFT JOIN.  So the allowed values of jointype
 * in a join_info_list member are only LEFT, FULL, SEMI, or ANTI.
 *
 * For purposes of join selectivity estimation, we create transient
 * SpecialJoinInfo structures for regular inner joins; so it is possible
 * to have jointype == JOIN_INNER in such a structure, even though this is
 * not allowed within join_info_list.  We also create transient
 * SpecialJoinInfos with jointype == JOIN_INNER for outer joins, since for
 * cost estimation purposes it is sometimes useful to know the join size under
 * plain innerjoin semantics.  Note that lhs_strict, delay_upper_joins, and
 * of course the semi_xxx fields are not set meaningfully within such structs.

 * Append-relation info.

 *
 * The PlaceHolderVar's expression might contain LATERAL references to vars
 * coming from outside its syntactic scope.  If so, those rels are *not*
 * included in ph_eval_at, but they are recorded in ph_lateral.
 *
 * Notice that when ph_eval_at is a join rather than a single baserel, the
 * PlaceHolderInfo may create constraints on join order: the ph_eval_at join
 * has to be formed below any outer joins that should null the PlaceHolderVar.
 *
 * We create a PlaceHolderInfo only after determining that the PlaceHolderVar
 * is actually referenced in the plan tree, so that unreferenced placeholders
 * don't result in unnecessary constraints on join order.

 * At runtime, PARAM_EXEC slots are used to pass values around from one plan
 * node to another.  They can be used to pass values down into subqueries (for
 * outer references in subqueries), or up out of subqueries (for the results
 * of a subplan), or from a NestLoop plan node into its inner relation (when
 * the inner scan is parameterized with values from the outer relation).
 * The planner is responsible for assigning nonconflicting PARAM_EXEC IDs to
 * the PARAM_EXEC Params it generates.
 *
 * Outer references are managed via root->plan_params, which is a list of
 * PlannerParamItems.  While planning a subquery, each parent query level's
 * plan_params contains the values required from it by the current subquery.
 * During create_plan(), we use plan_params to track values that must be
 * passed from outer to inner sides of NestLoop plan nodes.
 *
 * The item a PlannerParamItem represents can be one of three kinds:
 *
 * A Var: the slot represents a variable of this level that must be passed
 * down because subqueries have outer references to it, or must be passed
 * from a NestLoop node to its inner scan.  The varlevelsup value in the Var
 * will always be zero.
 *
 * A PlaceHolderVar: this works much like the Var case, except that the
 * entry is a PlaceHolderVar node with a contained expression.  The PHV
 * will have phlevelsup = 0, and the contained expression is adjusted
 * to match in level.
 *
 * An Aggref (with an expression tree representing its argument): the slot
 * represents an aggregate expression that is an outer reference for some
 * subquery.  The Aggref itself has agglevelsup = 0, and its argument tree
 * is adjusted to match in level.
 *
 * Note: we detect duplicate Var and PlaceHolderVar parameters and coalesce
 * them into one slot, but we do not bother to do that for Aggrefs.
 * The scope of duplicate-elimination only extends across the set of
 * parameters passed from one query level into a single subquery, or for
 * nestloop parameters across the set of nestloop parameters used in a single
 * query level.  So there is no possibility of a PARAM_EXEC slot being used
 * for conflicting purposes.
 *
 * In addition, PARAM_EXEC slots are assigned for Params representing outputs
 * from subplans (values that are setParam items for those subplans).  These
 * IDs need not be tracked via PlannerParamItems, since we do not need any
 * duplicate-elimination nor later processing of the represented expressions.
 * Instead, we just record the assignment of the slot number by appending to
 * root->glob->paramExecTypes.
