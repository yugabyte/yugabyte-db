/*
 * Aggref
 *
 * The aggregate's args list is a targetlist, ie, a list of TargetEntry nodes.
 *
 * For a normal (non-ordered-set) aggregate, the non-resjunk TargetEntries
 * represent the aggregate's regular arguments (if any) and resjunk TLEs can
 * be added at the end to represent ORDER BY expressions that are not also
 * arguments.  As in a top-level Query, the TLEs can be marked with
 * ressortgroupref indexes to let them be referenced by SortGroupClause
 * entries in the aggorder and/or aggdistinct lists.  This represents ORDER BY
 * and DISTINCT operations to be applied to the aggregate input rows before
 * they are passed to the transition function.  The grammar only allows a
 * simple "DISTINCT" specifier for the arguments, but we use the full
 * query-level representation to allow more code sharing.
 *
 * For an ordered-set aggregate, the args list represents the WITHIN GROUP
 * (aggregated) arguments, all of which will be listed in the aggorder list.
 * DISTINCT is not supported in this case, so aggdistinct will be NIL.
 * The direct arguments appear in aggdirectargs (as a list of plain
 * expressions, not TargetEntry nodes).
 *
 * aggtranstype is the data type of the state transition values for this
 * aggregate (resolved to an actual type, if agg's transtype is polymorphic).
 * This is determined during planning and is InvalidOid before that.
 *
 * aggargtypes is an OID list of the data types of the direct and regular
 * arguments.  Normally it's redundant with the aggdirectargs and args lists,
 * but in a combining aggregate, it's not because the args list has been
 * replaced with a single argument representing the partial-aggregate
 * transition values.
 *
 * aggsplit indicates the expected partial-aggregation mode for the Aggref's
 * parent plan node.  It's always set to AGGSPLIT_SIMPLE in the parser, but
 * the planner might change it to something else.  We use this mainly as
 * a crosscheck that the Aggrefs match the plan; but note that when aggsplit
 * indicates a non-final mode, aggtype reflects the transition data type
 * not the SQL-level output type of the aggregate.

 * GroupingFunc
 *
 * A GroupingFunc is a GROUPING(...) expression, which behaves in many ways

 * an important respect: it never evaluates its arguments, they merely
 * designate expressions from the GROUP BY clause of the query level to which
 * it belongs.
 *
 * The spec defines the evaluation of GROUPING() purely by syntactic
 * replacement, but we make it a real expression for optimization purposes so
 * that one Agg node can handle multiple grouping sets at once.  Evaluating the
 * result only needs the column positions to check against the grouping set
 * being projected.  However, for EXPLAIN to produce meaningful output, we have
 * to keep the original expressions around, since expression deparse does not
 * give us any feasible way to get at the GROUP BY clause.
 *
 * Also, we treat two GroupingFunc nodes as equal if they have equal arguments
 * lists and agglevelsup, without comparing the refs and cols annotations.
 *
 * In raw parse output we have only the args list; parse analysis fills in the
 * refs list, and the planner fills in the cols list.

/* ----------------
 *	ArrayRef: describes an array subscripting operation
 *
 * An ArrayRef can describe fetching a single element from an array,
 * fetching a subarray (array slice), storing a single element into
 * an array, or storing a slice.  The "store" cases work with an
 * initial array value and a source value that is inserted into the
 * appropriate part of the array; the result of the operation is an
 * entire new modified array value.
 *
 * If reflowerindexpr = NIL, then we are fetching or storing a single array
 * element at the subscripts given by refupperindexpr.  Otherwise we are
 * fetching or storing an array slice, that is a rectangular subarray
 * with lower and upper bounds given by the index expressions.
 * reflowerindexpr must be the same length as refupperindexpr when it
 * is not NIL.
 *
 * In the slice case, individual expressions in the subscript lists can be
 * NULL, meaning "substitute the array's current lower or upper bound".
 *
 * Note: the result datatype is the element type when fetching a single
 * element; but it is the array type when doing subarray fetch or either
 * type of store.
 *
 * Note: for the cases where an array is returned, if refexpr yields a R/W
 * expanded array, then the implementation is allowed to modify that object
 * in-place and return the same object.)

/*
 * SubLink
 *
 * A SubLink represents a subselect appearing in an expression, and in some
 * cases also the combining operator(s) just above it.  The subLinkType

 *	EXISTS_SUBLINK		EXISTS(SELECT ...)
 *	ALL_SUBLINK			(lefthand) op ALL (SELECT ...)
 *	ANY_SUBLINK			(lefthand) op ANY (SELECT ...)
 *	ROWCOMPARE_SUBLINK	(lefthand) op (SELECT ...)
 *	EXPR_SUBLINK		(SELECT with single targetlist item ...)
 *	MULTIEXPR_SUBLINK	(SELECT with multiple targetlist items ...)
 *	ARRAY_SUBLINK		ARRAY(SELECT with single targetlist item ...)
 *	CTE_SUBLINK			WITH query (never actually part of an expression)
 * For ALL, ANY, and ROWCOMPARE, the lefthand is a list of expressions of the
 * same length as the subselect's targetlist.  ROWCOMPARE will *always* have
 * a list with more than one entry; if the subselect has just one target
 * then the parser will create an EXPR_SUBLINK instead (and any operator
 * above the subselect will be represented separately).
 * ROWCOMPARE, EXPR, and MULTIEXPR require the subselect to deliver at most
 * one row (if it returns no rows, the result is NULL).
 * ALL, ANY, and ROWCOMPARE require the combining operators to deliver boolean
 * results.  ALL and ANY combine the per-row results using AND and OR
 * semantics respectively.
 * ARRAY requires just one target column, and creates an array of the target
 * column's type using any number of rows resulting from the subselect.
 *
 * SubLink is classed as an Expr node, but it is not actually executable;
 * it must be replaced in the expression tree by a SubPlan node during
 * planning.
 *
 * NOTE: in the raw output of gram.y, testexpr contains just the raw form
 * of the lefthand expression (if any), and operName is the String name of
 * the combining operator.  Also, subselect is a raw parsetree.  During parse
 * analysis, the parser transforms testexpr into a complete boolean expression
 * that compares the lefthand value(s) to PARAM_SUBLINK nodes representing the
 * output columns of the subselect.  And subselect is transformed to a Query.
 * This is the representation seen in saved rules and in the rewriter.
 *
 * In EXISTS, EXPR, MULTIEXPR, and ARRAY SubLinks, testexpr and operName
 * are unused and are always null.
 *
 * subLinkId is currently used only for MULTIEXPR SubLinks, and is zero in
 * other SubLinks.  This number identifies different multiple-assignment
 * subqueries within an UPDATE statement's SET list.  It is unique only
 * within a particular targetlist.  The output column(s) of the MULTIEXPR
 * are referenced by PARAM_MULTIEXPR Params appearing elsewhere in the tlist.

 * nodes after it has finished planning the subquery.  SubPlan references
 * a sub-plantree stored in the subplans list of the toplevel PlannedStmt.
 * (We avoid a direct link to make it easier to copy expression trees
 * without causing multiple processing of the subplan.)
 *
 * In an ordinary subplan, testexpr points to an executable expression
 * (OpExpr, an AND/OR tree of OpExprs, or RowCompareExpr) for the combining
 * operator(s); the left-hand arguments are the original lefthand expressions,
 * and the right-hand arguments are PARAM_EXEC Param nodes representing the
 * outputs of the sub-select.  (NOTE: runtime coercion functions may be
 * inserted as well.)  This is just the same expression tree as testexpr in
 * the original SubLink node, but the PARAM_SUBLINK nodes are replaced by
 * suitably numbered PARAM_EXEC nodes.
 *
 * If the sub-select becomes an initplan rather than a subplan, the executable
 * expression is part of the outer plan's expression tree (and the SubPlan
 * node itself is not, but rather is found in the outer plan's initPlan
 * list).  In this case testexpr is NULL to avoid duplication.
 *
 * The planner also derives lists of the values that need to be passed into
 * and out of the subplan.  Input values are represented as a list "args" of
 * expressions to be evaluated in the outer-query context (currently these
 * args are always just Vars, but in principle they could be any expression).
 * The values are assigned to the global PARAM_EXEC params indexed by parParam
 * (the parParam and args lists must have the same ordering).  setParam is a
 * list of the PARAM_EXEC params that are computed by the sub-select, if it
 * is an initplan; they are listed in order by sub-select output column
 * position.  (parParam and setParam are integer Lists, not Bitmapsets,
 * because their ordering is significant.)
 *
 * Also, the planner computes startup and per-call costs for use of the
 * SubPlan.  Note that these include the cost of the subquery proper,
 * evaluation of the testexpr if any, and any hashtable management overhead.

/*--------------------
 * TargetEntry -
 *	   a target entry (used in query target lists)
 *
 * Strictly speaking, a TargetEntry isn't an expression node (since it can't
 * be evaluated by ExecEvalExpr).  But we treat it as one anyway, since in
 * very many places it's convenient to process a whole query targetlist as a
 * single expression tree.
 *
 * In a SELECT's targetlist, resno should always be equal to the item's
 * ordinal position (counting from 1).  However, in an INSERT or UPDATE
 * targetlist, resno represents the attribute number of the destination
 * column for the item; so there may be missing or out-of-order resnos.
 * It is even legal to have duplicated resnos; consider
 *		UPDATE table SET arraycol[1] = ..., arraycol[2] = ..., ...
 * The two meanings come together in the executor, because the planner
 * transforms INSERT/UPDATE tlists into a normalized form with exactly
 * one entry for each column of the destination table.  Before that's
 * happened, however, it is risky to assume that resno == position.
 * Generally get_tle_by_resno() should be used rather than list_nth()
 * to fetch tlist entries by resno, and only in SELECT should you assume
 * that resno is a unique identifier.
 *
 * resname is required to represent the correct column name in non-resjunk
 * entries of top-level SELECT targetlists, since it will be used as the
 * column title sent to the frontend.  In most other contexts it is only
 * a debugging aid, and may be wrong or even NULL.  (In particular, it may
 * be wrong in a tlist from a stored rule, if the referenced column has been
 * renamed by ALTER TABLE since the rule was made.  Also, the planner tends
 * to store NULL rather than look up a valid name for tlist entries in
 * non-toplevel plan nodes.)  In resjunk entries, resname should be either
 * a specific system-generated name (such as "ctid") or NULL; anything else
 * risks confusing ExecGetJunkAttribute!
 *
 * ressortgroupref is used in the representation of ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and
 * DISTINCT items.  Targetlist entries with ressortgroupref=0 are not
 * sort/group items.  If ressortgroupref>0, then this item is an ORDER BY,
 * GROUP BY, and/or DISTINCT target value.  No two entries in a targetlist
 * may have the same nonzero ressortgroupref --- but there is no particular
 * meaning to the nonzero values, except as tags.  (For example, one must
 * not assume that lower ressortgroupref means a more significant sort key.)
 * The order of the associated SortGroupClause lists determine the semantics.
 *
 * resorigtbl/resorigcol identify the source of the column, if it is a
 * simple reference to a column of a base table (or view).  If it is not
 * a simple reference, these fields are zeroes.
 *
 * If resjunk is true then the column is a working column (such as a sort key)
 * that should be removed from the final output of the query.  Resjunk columns
 * must have resnos that cannot duplicate any regular column's resno.  Also
 * note that there are places that assume resjunk columns come after non-junk
 * columns.

 *					node types for join trees
 *
 * The leaves of a join tree structure are RangeTblRef nodes.  Above
 * these, JoinExpr nodes can appear to denote a specific kind of join
 * or qualified join.  Also, FromExpr nodes can appear to denote an
 * ordinary cross-product join ("FROM foo, bar, baz WHERE ...").
 * FromExpr is like a JoinExpr of jointype JOIN_INNER, except that it
 * may have any number of child nodes, not just two.
 *
 * NOTE: the top level of a Query's jointree is always a FromExpr.
 * Even if the jointree contains no rels, there will be a FromExpr.
 *
 * NOTE: the qualification expressions present in JoinExpr nodes are
 * *in addition to* the query's main WHERE clause, which appears as the
 * qual of the top-level FromExpr.  The reason for associating quals with
 * specific nodes in the jointree is that the position of a qual is critical
 * when outer joins are present.  (If we enforce a qual too soon or too late,
 * that may cause the outer join to produce the wrong set of NULL-extended
 * rows.)  If all joins are inner joins then all the qual positions are
 * semantically interchangeable.
 *
 * NOTE: in the raw output of gram.y, a join tree contains RangeVar,
 * RangeSubselect, and RangeFunction nodes, which are all replaced by
 * RangeTblRef nodes during the parse analysis phase.  Also, the top-level
 * FromExpr is added during parse analysis; the grammar regards FROM and
 * WHERE as separate.

/*
 * RangeTblRef - reference to an entry in the query's rangetable
 *
 * We could use direct pointers to the RT entries and skip having these
 * nodes, but multiple pointers to the same node in a querytree cause
 * lots of headaches, so it seems better to store an index into the RT.

/*----------
 * JoinExpr - for SQL JOIN expressions
 *
 * isNatural, usingClause, and quals are interdependent.  The user can write
 * only one of NATURAL, USING(), or ON() (this is enforced by the grammar).
 * If he writes NATURAL then parse analysis generates the equivalent USING()
 * list, and from that fills in "quals" with the right equality comparisons.
 * If he writes USING() then "quals" is filled with equality comparisons.
 * If he writes ON() then only "quals" is set.  Note that NATURAL/USING
 * are not equivalent to ON() since they also affect the output column list.
 *
 * alias is an Alias node representing the AS alias-clause attached to the
 * join expression, or NULL if no clause.  NB: presence or absence of the
 * alias has a critical impact on semantics, because a join with an alias
 * restricts visibility of the tables/columns inside it.
 *
 * During parse analysis, an RTE is created for the Join, and its index
 * is filled into rtindex.  This RTE is present mainly so that Vars can
 * be created that refer to the outputs of the join.  The planner sometimes
 * generates JoinExprs internally; these can have rtindex = 0 if there are
 * no join alias variables referencing such joins.
