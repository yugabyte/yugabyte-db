 * ScanKeywordLookup - see if a given word is a keyword
 *
 * The list of keywords to be matched against is passed as a ScanKeywordList.
 *
 * Returns the keyword number (0..N-1) of the keyword, or -1 if no match.
 * Callers typically use the keyword number to index into information
 * arrays, but that is no concern of this code.
 *
 * The match is done case-insensitively.  Note that we deliberately use a
 * dumbed-down case conversion that will only translate 'A'-'Z' into 'a'-'z',
 * even if we are in a locale where tolower() would produce more or different
 * translations.  This is to conform to the SQL99 spec, which says that
 * keywords are to be matched in this way even though non-keyword identifiers
 * receive a different case-normalization mapping.
