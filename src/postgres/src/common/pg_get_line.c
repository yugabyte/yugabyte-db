/*
 * pg_get_line()
 *
 * This is meant to be equivalent to fgets(), except that instead of
 * reading into a caller-supplied, fixed-size buffer, it reads into
 * a palloc'd (in frontend, really malloc'd) string, which is resized
 * as needed to handle indefinitely long input lines.  The caller is
 * responsible for pfree'ing the result string when appropriate.
 *
 * As with fgets(), returns NULL if there is a read error or if no
 * characters are available before EOF.  The caller can distinguish
 * these cases by checking ferror(stream).
 *
 * Since this is meant to be equivalent to fgets(), the trailing newline
 * (if any) is not stripped.  Callers may wish to apply pg_strip_crlf().
 *
 * Note that while I/O errors are reflected back to the caller to be
 * dealt with, an OOM condition for the palloc'd buffer will not be;
 * there'll be an ereport(ERROR) or exit(1) inside stringinfo.c.
 *
 * Also note that the palloc'd buffer is usually a lot longer than
 * strictly necessary, so it may be inadvisable to use this function
 * to collect lots of long-lived data.  A less memory-hungry option
 * is to use pg_get_line_buf() or pg_get_line_append() in a loop,
 * then pstrdup() each line.
 *
 * prompt_ctx can optionally be provided to allow this function to be
 * canceled via an existing SIGINT signal handler that will longjmp to the
 * specified place only when *(prompt_ctx->enabled) is true.  If canceled,
 * this function returns NULL, and prompt_ctx->canceled is set to true.

 * wants to read and process one line at a time, without any artificial
 * limit on line length.
 *

 * This is useful in preference to pg_get_line_buf() if the caller wants
 * to merge some lines together, e.g. to implement backslash continuation.
 *
 * Returns true if a line was successfully collected (including the
 * case of a non-newline-terminated line at EOF).  Returns false if
 * there was an I/O error or no data was available before EOF.
