/*
 * This function just reports whether this file was compiled for frontend
 * or backend environment.  We need this because in some systems, mainly
 * ELF-based platforms, it is possible for a shlib (such as libpq) loaded
 * into the backend to call a backend function named XYZ in preference to
 * the shlib's own function XYZ.  That's bad if the two functions don't
 * act identically.  This exact situation comes up for many functions in
 * src/common and src/port, where the same function names exist in both
 * libpq and the backend but they don't act quite identically.  To verify
 * that appropriate measures have been taken to prevent incorrect symbol
 * resolution, libpq should test that this function returns true.
