This directory contains tools to generate the tables in
src/include/common/unicode_norm.h, used for Unicode normalization. The
generated .h file is included in the source tree, so these are normally not
needed to build PostgreSQL, only if you need to re-generate the .h file
from the Unicode data files for some reason, e.g. to update to a new version
of Unicode.

Generating unicode_norm_table.h
-------------------------------

Run

    make update-unicode

from the top level of the source tree and commit the result.

Tests
-----

The Unicode consortium publishes a comprehensive test suite for the
normalization algorithm, in a file called NormalizationTest.txt. This
directory also contains a perl script and some C code, to run our
normalization code with all the test strings in NormalizationTest.txt.
To download NormalizationTest.txt and run the tests:

    make normalization-check

This is also run as part of the update-unicode target.
