 * psprintf

 * responsible to free the buffer when no longer needed, if appropriate.
 *
 * Errors are not returned to the caller, but are reported via elog(ERROR)
 * in the backend, or printf-to-stderr-and-exit() in frontend builds.
 * One should therefore think twice about using this in libpq.

 * pvsnprintf
 *
 * Attempt to format text data under the control of fmt (an sprintf-style
 * format string) and insert it into buf (which has length len).
 *
 * If successful, return the number of bytes emitted, not counting the
 * trailing zero byte.  This will always be strictly less than len.
 *
 * If there's not enough space in buf, return an estimate of the buffer size
 * needed to succeed (this *must* be more than the given len, else callers
 * might loop infinitely).
 *
 * Other error cases do not return, but exit via elog(ERROR) or exit().
 * Hence, this shouldn't be used inside libpq.
 *
 * Caution: callers must be sure to preserve their entry-time errno
 * when looping, in case the fmt contains "%m".
 *
 * Note that the semantics of the return value are not exactly C99's.
 * First, we don't promise that the estimated buffer size is exactly right;
 * callers must be prepared to loop multiple times to get the right size.
 * (Given a C99-compliant vsnprintf, that won't happen, but it is rumored
 * that some implementations don't always return the same value ...)
 * Second, we return the recommended buffer size, not one less than that;
 * this lets overflow concerns be handled here rather than in the callers.
