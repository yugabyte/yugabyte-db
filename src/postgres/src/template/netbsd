# Extra CFLAGS for code that will go into a shared library
CFLAGS_SL="-fPIC -DPIC"

# We must resolve all dynamic linking in the core server at program start.
# Otherwise the postmaster can self-deadlock due to signals interrupting
# resolution of calls, since NetBSD's linker takes a lock while doing that and
# some postmaster signal handlers do things that will also acquire that lock.
# As long as we need "-z now", might as well specify "-z relro" too.
# While there's not a hard reason to adopt these settings for our other
# executables, there's also little reason not to, so just add them to LDFLAGS.
LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -Wl,-z,now -Wl,-z,relro"
