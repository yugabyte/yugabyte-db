/*
 * extract_restriction_or_clauses
 *	  Examine join OR-of-AND clauses to see if any useful restriction OR
 *	  clauses can be extracted.  If so, add them to the query.
 *
 * Although a join clause must reference multiple relations overall,
 * an OR of ANDs clause might contain sub-clauses that reference just one
 * relation and can be used to build a restriction clause for that rel.
 * For example consider
 *		WHERE ((a.x = 42 AND b.y = 43) OR (a.x = 44 AND b.z = 45));
 * We can transform this into
 *		WHERE ((a.x = 42 AND b.y = 43) OR (a.x = 44 AND b.z = 45))
 *			AND (a.x = 42 OR a.x = 44)
 *			AND (b.y = 43 OR b.z = 45);
 * which allows the latter clauses to be applied during the scans of a and b,
 * perhaps as index qualifications, and in any case reducing the number of
 * rows arriving at the join.  In essence this is a partial transformation to
 * CNF (AND of ORs format).  It is not complete, however, because we do not
 * unravel the original OR --- doing so would usually bloat the qualification
 * expression to little gain.
 *
 * The added quals are partially redundant with the original OR, and therefore
 * would cause the size of the joinrel to be underestimated when it is finally
 * formed.  (This would be true of a full transformation to CNF as well; the
 * fault is not really in the transformation, but in clauselist_selectivity's
 * inability to recognize redundant conditions.)  We can compensate for this
 * redundancy by changing the cached selectivity of the original OR clause,
 * canceling out the (valid) reduction in the estimated sizes of the base
 * relations so that the estimated joinrel size remains the same.  This is
 * a MAJOR HACK: it depends on the fact that clause selectivities are cached
 * and on the fact that the same RestrictInfo node will appear in every
 * joininfo list that might be used when the joinrel is formed.
 * And it doesn't work in cases where the size estimation is nonlinear
 * (i.e., outer and IN joins).  But it beats not doing anything.
 *
 * We examine each base relation to see if join clauses associated with it
 * contain extractable restriction conditions.  If so, add those conditions
 * to the rel's baserestrictinfo and update the cached selectivities of the
 * join clauses.  Note that the same join clause will be examined afresh
 * from the point of view of each baserel that participates in it, so its
 * cached selectivity may get updated multiple times.
