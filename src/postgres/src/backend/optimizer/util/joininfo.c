 * relations.  This is intentional.  For example consider
 *		SELECT * FROM a, b, c WHERE a.x = (b.y + c.z)
 * If a is much larger than the other tables, it may be worthwhile to
 * cross-join b and c and then use an inner indexscan on a.x.  Therefore
 * we should consider this joinclause as reason to join b to c, even though
 * it can't be applied at that join step.
