 * Returns a new join relation whose cheapest path is the best plan for
 * this join order.  NB: will return NULL if join order is invalid and

 *
 * The original implementation of this routine always joined in the specified
 * order, and so could only build left-sided plans (and right-sided and
 * mixtures, as a byproduct of the fact that make_join_rel() is symmetric).
 * It could never produce a "bushy" plan.  This had a couple of big problems,
 * of which the worst was that there are situations involving join order
 * restrictions where the only valid plans are bushy.
 *
 * The present implementation takes the given tour as a guideline, but
 * postpones joins that are illegal or seem unsuitable according to some
 * heuristic rules.  This allows correct bushy plans to be generated at need,
 * and as a nice side-effect it seems to materially improve the quality of the
 * generated plans.  Note however that since it's just a heuristic, it can
 * still fail in some cases.  (In particular, we might clump together
 * relations that actually mustn't be joined yet due to LATERAL restrictions;
 * since there's no provision for un-clumping, this must lead to failure.)
