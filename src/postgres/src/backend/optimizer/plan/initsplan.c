	 * of "expensive" quals, this area would need work.

 * check_outerjoin_delay
 *		Detect whether a qual referencing the given relids must be delayed

 *
 * If the qual must be delayed, add relids to *relids_p to reflect the lowest
 * safe level for evaluating the qual, and return true.  Any extra delay for
 * higher-level joins is reflected by setting delay_upper_joins to true in
 * SpecialJoinInfo structs.  We also compute nullable_relids, the set of
 * referenced relids that are nullable by lower outer joins (note that this
 * can be nonempty even for a non-delayed qual).
 *
 * For an is_pushed_down qual, we can evaluate the qual as soon as (1) we have
 * all the rels it mentions, and (2) we are at or above any outer joins that
 * can null any of these rels and are below the syntactic location of the
 * given qual.  We must enforce (2) because pushing down such a clause below
 * the OJ might cause the OJ to emit null-extended rows that should not have
 * been formed, or that should have been rejected by the clause.  (This is
 * only an issue for non-strict quals, since if we can prove a qual mentioning
 * only nullable rels is strict, we'd have reduced the outer join to an inner
 * join in reduce_outer_joins().)
 *
 * To enforce (2), scan the join_info_list and merge the required-relid sets of
 * any such OJs into the clause's own reference list.  At the time we are
 * called, the join_info_list contains only outer joins below this qual.  We
 * have to repeat the scan until no new relids get added; this ensures that
 * the qual is suitably delayed regardless of the order in which OJs get
 * executed.  As an example, if we have one OJ with LHS=A, RHS=B, and one with
 * LHS=B, RHS=C, it is implied that these can be done in either order; if the
 * B/C join is done first then the join to A can null C, so a qual actually
 * mentioning only C cannot be applied below the join to A.
 *
 * For a non-pushed-down qual, this isn't going to determine where we place the
 * qual, but we need to determine outerjoin_delayed and nullable_relids anyway
 * for use later in the planning process.
 *
 * Lastly, a pushed-down qual that references the nullable side of any current
 * join_info_list member and has to be evaluated above that OJ (because its
 * required relids overlap the LHS too) causes that OJ's delay_upper_joins
 * flag to be set true.  This will prevent any higher-level OJs from
 * being interchanged with that OJ, which would result in not having any
 * correct place to evaluate the qual.  (The case we care about here is a
 * sub-select WHERE clause within the RHS of some outer join.  The WHERE
 * clause must effectively be treated as a degenerate clause of that outer
 * join's condition.  Rather than trying to match such clauses with joins
 * directly, we set delay_upper_joins here, and when the upper outer join
 * is processed by make_outerjoininfo, it will refrain from allowing the
 * two OJs to commute.)
