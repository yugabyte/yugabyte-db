 * parent_root is the immediate parent Query's info (NULL at the top level).

 * tuple_fraction is the fraction of tuples we expect will be retrieved.
 * tuple_fraction is interpreted as explained for grouping_planner, below.

 * Basically, this routine does the stuff that should only be done once
 * per Query object.  It then calls grouping_planner.  At one time,

 *
 * subquery_planner will be called recursively to handle sub-Query nodes
 * found within the query's expressions and rangetable.
 *
 * Returns the PlannerInfo struct ("root") that contains all data generated
 * while planning the subquery.  In particular, the Path(s) attached to
 * the (UPPERREL_FINAL, NULL) upperrel represent our conclusions about the

 *		from the plan to be retrieved
 *	  tuple_fraction >= 1: tuple_fraction is the absolute number of tuples

 * preprocess_groupclause - do preparatory work on GROUP BY clause

 * requirement and set up for a Unique step that implements GROUP BY.
 *
 * In principle it might be interesting to consider other orderings of the
 * GROUP BY elements, which could match the sort ordering of other
 * possible plans (eg an indexscan) and thereby reduce cost.  We don't
 * bother with that, though.  Hashed grouping will frequently win anyway.
 *
 * Note: we need no comparable processing of the distinctClause because
 * the parser already enforced that that matches ORDER BY.
 *
 * For grouping sets, the order of items is instead forced to agree with that
 * of the grouping set (and items not in the grouping set are skipped). The
 * work of sorting the order of grouping set elements to match the ORDER BY if
 * possible is done elsewhere.

 * make_sort_input_target
 *	  Generate appropriate PathTarget for initial input to Sort step.
 *
 * If the query has ORDER BY, this function chooses the target to be computed
 * by the node just below the Sort (and DISTINCT, if any, since Unique can't
 * project) steps.  This might or might not be identical to the query's final
 * output target.
 *
 * The main argument for keeping the sort-input tlist the same as the final
 * is that we avoid a separate projection node (which will be needed if
 * they're different, because Sort can't project).  However, there are also
 * advantages to postponing tlist evaluation till after the Sort: it ensures
 * a consistent order of evaluation for any volatile functions in the tlist,
 * and if there's also a LIMIT, we can stop the query without ever computing
 * tlist functions for later rows, which is beneficial for both volatile and
 * expensive functions.
 *
 * Our current policy is to postpone volatile expressions till after the sort
 * unconditionally (assuming that that's possible, ie they are in plain tlist
 * columns and not ORDER BY/GROUP BY/DISTINCT columns).  We also prefer to
 * postpone set-returning expressions, because running them beforehand would
 * bloat the sort dataset, and because it might cause unexpected output order
 * if the sort isn't stable.  However there's a constraint on that: all SRFs
 * in the tlist should be evaluated at the same plan step, so that they can
 * run in sync in nodeProjectSet.  So if any SRFs are in sort columns, we
 * mustn't postpone any SRFs.  (Note that in principle that policy should
 * probably get applied to the group/window input targetlists too, but we
 * have not done that historically.)  Lastly, expensive expressions are
 * postponed if there is a LIMIT, or if root->tuple_fraction shows that
 * partial evaluation of the query is possible (if neither is true, we expect
 * to have to evaluate the expressions for every row anyway), or if there are
 * any volatile or set-returning expressions (since once we've put in a
 * projection at all, it won't cost any more to postpone more stuff).
 *
 * Another issue that could potentially be considered here is that
 * evaluating tlist expressions could result in data that's either wider
 * or narrower than the input Vars, thus changing the volume of data that
 * has to go through the Sort.  However, we usually have only a very bad
 * idea of the output width of any expression more complex than a Var,
 * so for now it seems too risky to try to optimize on that basis.
 *
 * Note that if we do produce a modified sort-input target, and then the
 * query ends up not using an explicit Sort, no particular harm is done:
 * we'll initially use the modified target for the preceding path nodes,
 * but then change them to the final target with apply_projection_to_path.
 * Moreover, in such a case the guarantees about evaluation order of
 * volatile functions still hold, since the rows are sorted already.
 *
 * This function has some things in common with make_group_input_target and
 * make_window_input_target, though the detailed rules for what to do are
 * different.  We never flatten/postpone any grouping or ordering columns;
 * those are needed before the sort.  If we do flatten a particular
 * expression, we leave Aggref and WindowFunc nodes alone, since those were
 * computed earlier.
 *
 * 'final_target' is the query's final target list (in PathTarget form)
 * 'have_postponed_srfs' is an output argument, see below
 *
 * The result is the PathTarget to be computed by the plan node immediately
 * below the Sort step (and the Distinct step, if any).  This will be
 * exactly final_target if we decide a projection step wouldn't be helpful.
 *
 * In addition, *have_postponed_srfs is set to true if we choose to postpone
 * any set-returning functions to after the Sort.

 * side-effect that is useful when the expression will get evaluated more than

 *
 * This does not return any information about dependencies of the expression.
 * Hence callers should use the results only for the duration of the current
 * query.  Callers that would like to cache the results for longer should use
 * expression_planner_with_deps, probably via the plancache.
 *
 * Note: this must not make any damaging changes to the passed-in expression
 * tree.  (It would actually be okay to apply fix_opfuncids to it, but since
