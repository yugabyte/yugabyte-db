 * YB: yb_satisfies_distinct
 *
 * Returns true when the path 'pathnode' is DISTINCT enough to satisfy the
 * query 'root'. When true, 'pathnode' can be added directly when generating
 * distinct paths for the relation. This saves us additional computation/nodes
 * on top.
 *
 * Proving whether or not a path is DISTINCT enough is tricky.
 * We compare the query's distinctClause with path's uniqkeys for this
 * task. We use the help of examples to better explain how we prove that a
 * path is DISTINCT enough for the query.
 *
 * In the following examples, we have a table t, with columns k1, k2, k3.
 * For the purposes of the proof, it does not matter whether the columns are
 * range columns or not. We also assume here that 'uniqkeys' accurately captures
 * the set/tuple of keys that are DISTINCT in the path's output. In other words,
 * if uniqkeys = (k1, k2) then no two tuples in the output have the same value
 * of (k1, k2) pair.
 *
 * Example 1: SELECT DISTINCT k1, k2 FROM t;
 * In this simple case, assume that our path has uniqkeys (k1, k2). This path
 * is distinct enough for the query by definition of uniqkeys.
 *
 * Example 2: SELECT DISTINCT k2 FROM t;
 * We assume that the path has uniqkeys (k1, k2) in this case as well. This
 * path has more rows than necessary for the query. For example, there may be
 * only a single distinct value of k2 but many values of k1. This means we have
 * many values of (k1, k2) pairs but only a single value of k2. Additional
 * DISTINCTification is required on top of this path to satisfy the query.
 *
 * Example 3: SELECT DISTINCT k2, k1 FROM t;
 * Again, here we assume that the path has uniqkeys (k1, k2). In this case, the
 * path is distinct enough for the query. The reason is pretty intuitive but
 * let's use a more formal argument. We need to prove: (k1, k2) is distinct
 * implies that (k2, k1) is also distinct. On the contrary assume that the
 * path's output  has duplicate values (r2, r1) = (s2, s1). This implies that
 * r2 = s2 and r1 = s1. But this is a contradiction since (k1, k2) pair is
 * distinct.
 * Thus, distinctness is preserved through permutation of keys.
 *
 * XXX: We also need to prove that we collect all the distinct values of
 * k2, k1 in the output and not just prove that there are no duplicate values.
 * We skip such proofs here for brevity.
 *
 * Example 4: SeqScan(t) SELECT DISTINCT k2 FROM t WHERE k2 = 1;
 * Unlike the sort+unique node method of distinct, proving distinctness here
 * requires that we include constants as well in uniqkeys. In this example,
 * we cannot simply ignore k2 because it is equal to 1. The path's uniqkeys must
 * have k2. Otherwise, the path's output can have duplicate values of 1.
 *
 * Example 5: SELECT DISTINCT k2 FROM t WHERE k1 = 1;
 * Assume that the path has uniqkeys (k1, k2) then it is distinct enough for
 * the query. For that, we need to prove: (k1, k2) is distinct and k1 = 1
 * implies that (k2) is also distinct. On the contrary assume that there are
 * duplicate values of k2. This means there are two tuples (r2) = (s2) but this
 * implies that (1, r2) = (1, s2) and since r1 = 1, we have (r1, r2) = (s1, s2).
 * This is a contradiction since (k1, k2) is distinct.
 * Thus, excess keys equal to a constant do not affect the distinctness of the
 * the query. See Example 2 for why we need to check for excess keys.
 *
 * Example 6: SELECT DISTINCT k2 FROM t WHERE k1 = k2;
 * Assume that the path has uniqkeys (k1, k2). This path is distinct enough
 * because even though k1 is an excess key, k1 has the same values as k2.
 * Here, we need to prove: (k1, k2) is distinct and k1 = k2 implies that (k2)
 * is also distinct. On the contrary assume that there are duplicate values of
 * k2. This means there are two tuples (r2) = (s2). But this implies that
 * (r2, r2) = (s2, s2) and since r1 = r2, we have (r1, r2) = (s1, s2). This is
 * a contradiction since (k1, k2) is distinct.
 * Thus, excess columns equal to required columns do not impact the
 * distinctness of query, similar to Example 5.
 *
 * Example 7: SELECT DISTINCT k2 FROM t WHERE k1 = k2;
 * Instead, say the path only has (k1) in its uniqkeys. This path is NOT
 * distinct enough. For example, consider the tuples (1, 1), (2, 1). The path
 * outputs 1, 1 but the query only requires 1. In practice, this scenario
 * does not occur since we always include all the required columns in the
 * set of uniqkeys.
 *
 * In summary, we first check if all the distinct columns required by the query
 * are present in the path's uniqkeys. Next, we also check that the path is not
 * distinct on any excess columns.
