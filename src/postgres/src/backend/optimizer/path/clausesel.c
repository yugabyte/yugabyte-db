/*
 * clauselist_selectivity -
 *	  Compute the selectivity of an implicitly-ANDed list of boolean
 *	  expression clauses.  The list can be empty, in which case 1.0
 *	  must be returned.  List elements may be either RestrictInfos
 *	  or bare expression clauses --- the former is preferred since
 *	  it allows caching of results.
 *
 * See clause_selectivity() for the meaning of the additional parameters.
 *
 * The basic approach is to apply extended statistics first, on as many
 * clauses as possible, in order to capture cross-column dependencies etc.
 * The remaining clauses are then estimated by taking the product of their
 * selectivities, but that's only right if they have independent
 * probabilities, and in reality they are often NOT independent even if they
 * only refer to a single column.  So, we want to be smarter where we can.
 *
 * We also recognize "range queries", such as "x > 34 AND x < 42".  Clauses
 * are recognized as possible range query components if they are restriction
 * opclauses whose operators have scalarltsel or a related function as their
 * restriction selectivity estimator.  We pair up clauses of this form that
 * refer to the same variable.  An unpairable clause of this kind is simply
 * multiplied into the selectivity product in the normal way.  But when we
 * find a pair, we know that the selectivities represent the relative
 * positions of the low and high bounds within the column's range, so instead
 * of figuring the selectivity as hisel * losel, we can figure it as hisel +
 * losel - 1.  (To visualize this, see that hisel is the fraction of the range
 * below the high bound, while losel is the fraction above the low bound; so
 * hisel can be interpreted directly as a 0..1 value but we need to convert
 * losel to 1-losel before interpreting it as a value.  Then the available
 * range is 1-losel to hisel.  However, this calculation double-excludes
 * nulls, so really we need hisel + losel + null_frac - 1.)
 *
 * If either selectivity is exactly DEFAULT_INEQ_SEL, we forget this equation
 * and instead use DEFAULT_RANGE_INEQ_SEL.  The same applies if the equation
 * yields an impossible (negative) result.
 *
 * A free side-effect is that we can recognize redundant inequalities such
 * as "x < 4 AND x < 5"; only the tighter constraint will be counted.
 *
 * Of course this is all very dependent on the behavior of the inequality
 * selectivity functions; perhaps some day we can generalize the approach.
