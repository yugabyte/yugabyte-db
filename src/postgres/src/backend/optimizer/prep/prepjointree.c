 * pull_up_sublinks
 *		Attempt to pull up ANY and EXISTS SubLinks to be treated as
 *		semijoins or anti-semijoins.
 *
 * A clause "foo op ANY (sub-SELECT)" can be processed by pulling the
 * sub-SELECT up to become a rangetable entry and treating the implied
 * comparisons as quals of a semijoin.  However, this optimization *only*
 * works at the top level of WHERE or a JOIN/ON clause, because we cannot
 * distinguish whether the ANY ought to return FALSE or NULL in cases
 * involving NULL inputs.  Also, in an outer join's ON clause we can only
 * do this if the sublink is degenerate (ie, references only the nullable
 * side of the join).  In that case it is legal to push the semijoin
 * down into the nullable side of the join.  If the sublink references any
 * nonnullable-side variables then it would have to be evaluated as part
 * of the outer join, which makes things way too complicated.
 *
 * Under similar conditions, EXISTS and NOT EXISTS clauses can be handled
 * by pulling up the sub-SELECT and creating a semijoin or anti-semijoin.
 *
 * This routine searches for such clauses and does the necessary parsetree
 * transformations if any are found.
 *
 * This routine has to run before preprocess_expression(), so the quals
 * clauses are not yet reduced to implicit-AND format, and are not guaranteed
 * to be AND/OR-flat either.  That means we need to recursively search through
 * explicit AND clauses.  We stop as soon as we hit a non-AND item.

 * This recursively processes the jointree and returns a modified jointree.
 *
 * If this jointree node is within either side of an outer join, then
 * lowest_outer_join references the lowest such JoinExpr node; otherwise
 * it is NULL.  We use this to constrain the effects of LATERAL subqueries.
 *
 * If this jointree node is within the nullable side of an outer join, then
 * lowest_nulling_outer_join references the lowest such JoinExpr node;
 * otherwise it is NULL.  This forces use of the PlaceHolderVar mechanism for
 * references to non-nullable targetlist items, but only for references above
 * that join.
 *
 * If we are looking at a member subquery of an append relation,
 * containing_appendrel describes that relation; else it is NULL.
 * This forces use of the PlaceHolderVar mechanism for all non-Var targetlist
 * items, and puts some additional restrictions on what can be pulled up.
 *
 * A tricky aspect of this code is that if we pull up a subquery we have
 * to replace Vars that reference the subquery's outputs throughout the
 * parent query, including quals attached to jointree nodes above the one
 * we are currently processing!  We handle this by being careful to maintain
 * validity of the jointree structure while recursing, in the following sense:
 * whenever we recurse, all qual expressions in the tree must be reachable
 * from the top level, in case the recursive call needs to modify them.
 *
 * Notice also that we can't turn pullup_replace_vars loose on the whole
 * jointree, because it'd return a mutated copy of the tree; we have to
 * invoke it just on the quals, instead.  This behavior is what makes it
 * reasonable to pass lowest_outer_join and lowest_nulling_outer_join as
 * pointers rather than some more-indirect way of identifying the lowest
 * OJs.  Likewise, we don't replace append_rel_list members but only their
 * substructure, so the containing_appendrel reference is safe to use.

 * reduce_outer_joins
 *		Attempt to reduce outer joins to plain inner joins.
 *
 * The idea here is that given a query like
 *		SELECT ... FROM a LEFT JOIN b ON (...) WHERE b.y = 42;
 * we can reduce the LEFT JOIN to a plain JOIN if the "=" operator in WHERE
 * is strict.  The strict operator will always return NULL, causing the outer
 * WHERE to fail, on any row where the LEFT JOIN filled in NULLs for b's
 * columns.  Therefore, there's no need for the join to produce null-extended
 * rows in the first place --- which makes it a plain join not an outer join.
 * (This scenario may not be very likely in a query written out by hand, but
 * it's reasonably likely when pushing quals down into complex views.)
 *
 * More generally, an outer join can be reduced in strength if there is a
 * strict qual above it in the qual tree that constrains a Var from the
 * nullable side of the join to be non-null.  (For FULL joins this applies
 * to each side separately.)
 *
 * Another transformation we apply here is to recognize cases like
 *		SELECT ... FROM a LEFT JOIN b ON (a.x = b.y) WHERE b.y IS NULL;
 * If the join clause is strict for b.y, then only null-extended rows could
 * pass the upper WHERE, and we can conclude that what the query is really
 * specifying is an anti-semijoin.  We change the join type from JOIN_LEFT
 * to JOIN_ANTI.  The IS NULL clause then becomes redundant, and must be
 * removed to prevent bogus selectivity calculations, but we leave it to
 * distribute_qual_to_rels to get rid of such clauses.
 *
 * Also, we get rid of JOIN_RIGHT cases by flipping them around to become
 * JOIN_LEFT.  This saves some code here and in some later planner routines,
 * but the main reason to do it is to not need to invent a JOIN_REVERSE_ANTI
 * join type.
 *
 * To ease recognition of strict qual clauses, we require this routine to be
 * run after expression preprocessing (i.e., qual canonicalization and JOIN
 * alias-var expansion).

 * remove_useless_result_rtes
 *		Attempt to remove RTE_RESULT RTEs from the join tree.
 *
 * We can remove RTE_RESULT entries from the join tree using the knowledge
 * that RTE_RESULT returns exactly one row and has no output columns.  Hence,
 * if one is inner-joined to anything else, we can delete it.  Optimizations
 * are also possible for some outer-join cases, as detailed below.
 *
 * Some of these optimizations depend on recognizing empty (constant-true)
 * quals for FromExprs and JoinExprs.  That makes it useful to apply this
 * optimization pass after expression preprocessing, since that will have
 * eliminated constant-true quals, allowing more cases to be recognized as
 * optimizable.  What's more, the usual reason for an RTE_RESULT to be present
 * is that we pulled up a subquery or VALUES clause, thus very possibly
 * replacing Vars with constants, making it more likely that a qual can be
 * reduced to constant true.  Also, because some optimizations depend on
 * the outer-join type, it's best to have done reduce_outer_joins() first.
 *
 * A PlaceHolderVar referencing an RTE_RESULT RTE poses an obstacle to this
 * process: we must remove the RTE_RESULT's relid from the PHV's phrels, but
 * we must not reduce the phrels set to empty.  If that would happen, and
 * the RTE_RESULT is an immediate child of an outer join, we have to give up
 * and not remove the RTE_RESULT: there is noplace else to evaluate the
 * PlaceHolderVar.  (That is, in such cases the RTE_RESULT *does* have output
 * columns.)  But if the RTE_RESULT is an immediate child of an inner join,
 * we can usually change the PlaceHolderVar's phrels so as to evaluate it at
 * the inner join instead.  This is OK because we really only care that PHVs
 * are evaluated above or below the correct outer joins.  We can't, however,
 * postpone the evaluation of a PHV to above where it is used; so there are
 * some checks below on whether output PHVs are laterally referenced in the
 * other join input rel(s).
 *
 * We used to try to do this work as part of pull_up_subqueries() where the
 * potentially-optimizable cases get introduced; but it's way simpler, and
 * more effective, to do it separately.
