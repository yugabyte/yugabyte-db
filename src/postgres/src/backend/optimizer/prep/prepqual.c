 * While the parser will produce flattened (N-argument) AND/OR trees from
 * simple sequences of AND'ed or OR'ed clauses, there might be an AND clause
 * directly underneath another AND, or OR underneath OR, if the input was
 * oddly parenthesized.  Also, rule expansion and subquery flattening could
 * produce such parsetrees.  The planner wants to flatten all such cases
 * to ensure consistent optimization behavior.
 *
 * Formerly, this module was responsible for doing the initial flattening,
 * but now we leave it to eval_const_expressions to do that since it has to
 * make a complete pass over the expression tree anyway.  Instead, we just
 * have to ensure that our manipulations preserve AND/OR flatness.
 * pull_ands() and pull_ors() are used to maintain flatness of the AND/OR
 * tree after local transformations that might introduce nested AND/ORs.

/*
 * negate_clause
 *	  Negate a Boolean expression.
 *
 * Input is a clause to be negated (e.g., the argument of a NOT clause).
 * Returns a new clause equivalent to the negation of the given clause.
 *
 * Although this can be invoked on its own, it's mainly intended as a helper
 * for eval_const_expressions(), and that context drives several design
 * decisions.  In particular, if the input is already AND/OR flat, we must
 * preserve that property.  We also don't bother to recurse in situations
 * where we can assume that lower-level executions of eval_const_expressions
 * would already have simplified sub-clauses of the input.
 *
 * The difference between this and a simple make_notclause() is that this
 * tries to get rid of the NOT node by logical simplification.  It's clearly
 * always a win if the NOT node can be eliminated altogether.  However, our
 * use of DeMorgan's laws could result in having more NOT nodes rather than
 * fewer.  We do that unconditionally anyway, because in WHERE clauses it's
 * important to expose as much top-level AND/OR structure as possible.
 * Also, eliminating an intermediate NOT may allow us to flatten two levels
 * of AND or OR together that we couldn't have otherwise.  Finally, one of
 * the motivations for doing this is to ensure that logically equivalent
 * expressions will be seen as physically equal(), so we should always apply
 * the same transformations.
