 * Partition descriptor is a complex structure; to avoid complicated logic to

 * its own memory context, a child of CacheMemoryContext, which can easily be
 * deleted on its own.  To avoid leaking memory in that context in case of an
 * error partway through this function, the context is initially created as a
 * child of CurTransactionContext and only re-parented to CacheMemoryContext
 * at the end, when no further errors are possible.  Also, we don't make this
 * context the current context except in very brief code sections, out of fear
 * that some of our callees allocate memory on their own which would be leaked
 * permanently.
 *
 * As a special case, partition descriptors that are requested to omit
 * partitions being detached (and which contain such partitions) are transient
 * and are not associated with the relcache entry.  Such descriptors only last
 * through the requesting Portal, so we use the corresponding memory context
 * for them.
