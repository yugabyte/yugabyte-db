 *
 * A Gather executor launches parallel workers to run multiple copies of a
 * plan.  It can also run the plan itself, if the workers are not available
 * or have not started up yet.  It then merges all of the results it produces
 * and the results from the workers into a single output stream.  Therefore,
 * it will normally be used with a plan where running multiple copies of the
 * same plan does not produce duplicate output, such as parallel-aware
 * SeqScan.
 *
 * Alternatively, a Gather node can be configured to use just one worker
 * and the single-copy flag can be set.  In this case, the Gather node will
 * run the plan in one worker and will not execute the plan itself.  In
 * this case, it simply returns whatever tuples were returned by the worker.
 * If a worker cannot be obtained, then it will run the plan itself and
 * return the results.  Therefore, a plan used with a single-copy Gather
 * node need not be parallel-aware.
