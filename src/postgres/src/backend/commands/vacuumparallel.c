 * vacuumparallel.c
 *	  Support routines for parallel vacuum execution.
 *
 * This file contains routines that are intended to support setting up, using,
 * and tearing down a ParallelVacuumState.
 *
 * In a parallel vacuum, we perform both index bulk deletion and index cleanup
 * with parallel worker processes.  Individual indexes are processed by one
 * vacuum process.  ParalleVacuumState contains shared information as well as
 * the memory space for storing dead items allocated in the DSM segment.  We
 * launch parallel worker processes at the start of parallel index
 * bulk-deletion and index cleanup and once all indexes are processed, the
 * parallel worker processes exit.  Each time we process indexes in parallel,
 * the parallel context is re-initialized so that the same DSM can be used for
 * multiple passes of index bulk-deletion and index cleanup.
