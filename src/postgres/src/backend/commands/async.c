/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Async Notification Model as of 9.0:
 *
 * 1. Multiple backends on same machine. Multiple backends listening on
 *	  several channels. (Channels are also called "conditions" in other
 *	  parts of the code.)
 *
 * 2. There is one central queue in disk-based storage (directory pg_notify/),
 *	  with actively-used pages mapped into shared memory by the slru.c module.
 *	  All notification messages are placed in the queue and later read out
 *	  by listening backends.
 *
 *	  There is no central knowledge of which backend listens on which channel;
 *	  every backend has its own list of interesting channels.
 *
 *	  Although there is only one queue, notifications are treated as being
 *	  database-local; this is done by including the sender's database OID
 *	  in each notification message.  Listening backends ignore messages
 *	  that don't match their database OID.  This is important because it
 *	  ensures senders and receivers have the same database encoding and won't
 *	  misinterpret non-ASCII text in the channel name or payload string.
 *
 *	  Since notifications are not expected to survive database crashes,
 *	  we can simply clean out the pg_notify data at any reboot, and there
 *	  is no need for WAL support or fsync'ing.
 *
 * 3. Every backend that is listening on at least one channel registers by
 *	  entering its PID into the array in AsyncQueueControl. It then scans all
 *	  incoming notifications in the central queue and first compares the
 *	  database OID of the notification with its own database OID and then
 *	  compares the notified channel with the list of channels that it listens
 *	  to. In case there is a match it delivers the notification event to its
 *	  frontend.  Non-matching events are simply skipped.
 *
 * 4. The NOTIFY statement (routine Async_Notify) stores the notification in
 *	  a backend-local list which will not be processed until transaction end.
 *
 *	  Duplicate notifications from the same transaction are sent out as one
 *	  notification only. This is done to save work when for example a trigger
 *	  on a 2 million row table fires a notification for each row that has been
 *	  changed. If the application needs to receive every single notification
 *	  that has been sent, it can easily add some unique string into the extra
 *	  payload parameter.
 *
 *	  When the transaction is ready to commit, PreCommit_Notify() adds the
 *	  pending notifications to the head of the queue. The head pointer of the
 *	  queue always points to the next free position and a position is just a
 *	  page number and the offset in that page. This is done before marking the
 *	  transaction as committed in clog. If we run into problems writing the
 *	  notifications, we can still call elog(ERROR, ...) and the transaction
 *	  will roll back.
 *
 *	  Once we have put all of the notifications into the queue, we return to
 *	  CommitTransaction() which will then do the actual transaction commit.
 *
 *	  After commit we are called another time (AtCommit_Notify()). Here we
 *	  make any actual updates to the effective listen state (listenChannels).
 *	  Then we signal any backends that may be interested in our messages
 *	  (including our own backend, if listening).  This is done by
 *	  SignalBackends(), which scans the list of listening backends and sends a
 *	  PROCSIG_NOTIFY_INTERRUPT signal to every listening backend (we don't
 *	  know which backend is listening on which channel so we must signal them
 *	  all).  We can exclude backends that are already up to date, though, and
 *	  we can also exclude backends that are in other databases (unless they
 *	  are way behind and should be kicked to make them advance their
 *	  pointers).
 *
 *	  Finally, after we are out of the transaction altogether and about to go
 *	  idle, we scan the queue for messages that need to be sent to our
 *	  frontend (which might be notifies from other backends, or self-notifies
 *	  from our own).  This step is not part of the CommitTransaction sequence
 *	  for two important reasons.  First, we could get errors while sending
 *	  data to our frontend, and it's really bad for errors to happen in
 *	  post-commit cleanup.  Second, in cases where a procedure issues commits
 *	  within a single frontend command, we don't want to send notifies to our
 *	  frontend until the command is done; but notifies to other backends
 *	  should go out immediately after each commit.
 *
 * 5. Upon receipt of a PROCSIG_NOTIFY_INTERRUPT signal, the signal handler
 *	  sets the process's latch, which triggers the event to be processed
 *	  immediately if this backend is idle (i.e., it is waiting for a frontend
 *	  command and is not within a transaction block. C.f.
 *	  ProcessClientReadInterrupt()).  Otherwise the handler may only set a
 *	  flag, which will cause the processing to occur just before we next go
 *	  idle.
 *
 *	  Inbound-notify processing consists of reading all of the notifications
 *	  that have arrived since scanning last time. We read every notification
 *	  until we reach either a notification from an uncommitted transaction or
 *	  the head pointer's position.
 *
 * 6. To avoid SLRU wraparound and limit disk space consumption, the tail
 *	  pointer needs to be advanced so that old pages can be truncated.
 *	  This is relatively expensive (notably, it requires an exclusive lock),
 *	  so we don't want to do it often.  We make sending backends do this work
 *	  if they advanced the queue head into a new page, but only once every
 *	  QUEUE_CLEANUP_DELAY pages.
 *
 * An application that listens on the same channel it notifies will get
 * NOTIFY messages for its own NOTIFYs.  These can be ignored, if not useful,
 * by comparing be_pid in the NOTIFY message to the application's own backend's
 * PID.  (As of FE/BE protocol 2.0, the backend's PID is provided to the
 * frontend during startup.)  The above design guarantees that notifies from
 * other backends will never be missed by ignoring self-notifies.
 *
 * The amount of shared memory used for notify management (NUM_NOTIFY_BUFFERS)
 * can be varied without affecting anything but performance.  The maximum
 * amount of notification data that can be queued at one time is determined
 * by slru.c's wraparound limit; see QUEUE_MAX_PAGE below.
