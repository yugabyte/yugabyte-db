 *	  Data structure to hold a large set of 64-bit integers efficiently
 *
 * IntegerSet provides an in-memory data structure to hold a set of
 * arbitrary 64-bit integers.  Internally, the values are stored in a
 * B-tree, with a special packed representation at the leaf level using
 * the Simple-8b algorithm, which can pack clusters of nearby values
 * very tightly.
 *
 * Memory consumption depends on the number of values stored, but also
 * on how far the values are from each other.  In the best case, with
 * long runs of consecutive integers, memory consumption can be as low as
 * 0.1 bytes per integer.  In the worst case, if integers are more than
 * 2^32 apart, it uses about 8 bytes per integer.  In typical use, the
 * consumption per integer is somewhere between those extremes, depending
 * on the range of integers stored, and how "clustered" they are.
 *
 *
 * Interface
 * ---------
 *
 *	intset_create			- Create a new, empty set
 *	intset_add_member		- Add an integer to the set
 *	intset_is_member		- Test if an integer is in the set
 *	intset_begin_iterate	- Begin iterating through all integers in set
 *	intset_iterate_next		- Return next set member, if any
 *
 * intset_create() creates the set in the current memory context.  Subsequent
 * operations that add to the data structure will continue to allocate from
 * that same context, even if it's not current anymore.
 *
 * Note that there is no function to free an integer set.  If you need to do
 * that, create a dedicated memory context to hold it, and destroy the memory
 * context instead.
 *
 *
 * Limitations
 * -----------
 *
 * - Values must be added in order.  (Random insertions would require
 *   splitting nodes, which hasn't been implemented.)
 *
 * - Values cannot be added while iteration is in progress.
 *
 * - No support for removing values.
 *
 * None of these limitations are fundamental to the data structure, so they
 * could be lifted if needed, by writing some new code.  But the current
 * users of this facility don't need them.

/*
 * Node structures, for the in-memory B-tree.
 *
 * An internal node holds a number of downlink pointers to leaf nodes, or
 * to internal nodes on a lower level.  For each downlink, the key value
 * corresponding to the lower level node is stored in a sorted array.  The
 * stored key values are low keys.  In other words, if the downlink has value
 * X, then all items stored on that child are >= X.
 *
 * Each leaf node holds a number of "items", with a varying number of
 * integers packed into each item.  Each item consists of two 64-bit words:
 * The first word holds the first integer stored in the item, in plain format.
 * The second word contains between 0 and 240 more integers, packed using
 * Simple-8b encoding.  By storing the first integer in plain, unpacked,
 * format, we can use binary search to quickly find an item that holds (or
 * would hold) a particular integer.  And by storing the rest in packed form,
 * we still get pretty good memory density, if there are clusters of integers
 * with similar values.
 *
 * Each leaf node also has a pointer to the next leaf node, so that the leaf
 * nodes can be easily walked from beginning to end when iterating.

 * 60-bit integer, or two 30-bit integers, for example.
 *
 * Since we're storing a unique, sorted, set of integers, we actually encode
 * the *differences* between consecutive integers.  That way, clusters of
 * integers that are close to each other are packed efficiently, regardless
 * of their absolute values.
 *
 * In Simple-8b, each codeword consists of a 4-bit selector, which indicates
 * how many integers are encoded in the codeword, and the encoded integers are
 * packed into the remaining 60 bits.  The selector allows for 16 different
 * ways of using the remaining 60 bits, called "modes".  The number of integers
 * packed into a single codeword in each mode is listed in the simple8b_modes
 * table below.  For example, consider the following codeword:
 *
 *      20-bit integer       20-bit integer       20-bit integer
 * 1101 00000000000000010010 01111010000100100000 00000000000000010100
 * ^
 * selector
 *
 * The selector 1101 is 13 in decimal.  From the modes table below, we see
 * that it means that the codeword encodes three 20-bit integers.  In decimal,
 * those integers are 18, 500000 and 20.  Because we encode deltas rather than
 * absolute values, the actual values that they represent are 18, 500018 and
 * 500038.
 *
 * Modes 0 and 1 are a bit special; they encode a run of 240 or 120 zeroes
 * (which means 240 or 120 consecutive integers, since we're encoding the
 * deltas between integers), without using the rest of the codeword bits
 * for anything.
 *
 * Simple-8b cannot encode integers larger than 60 bits.  Values larger than
 * that are always stored in the 'first' field of a leaf item, never in the
 * packed codeword.  If there is a sequence of integers that are more than
 * 2^60 apart, the codeword will go unused on those items.  To represent that,
 * we use a magic EMPTY_CODEWORD codeword value.
