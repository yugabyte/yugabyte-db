 * bloomfilter.c
 *		Space-efficient set membership testing
 *
 * A Bloom filter is a probabilistic data structure that is used to test an
 * element's membership of a set.  False positives are possible, but false
 * negatives are not; a test of membership of the set returns either "possibly
 * in set" or "definitely not in set".  This is typically very space efficient,
 * which can be a decisive advantage.
 *
 * Elements can be added to the set, but not removed.  The more elements that
 * are added, the larger the probability of false positives.  Caller must hint
 * an estimated total size of the set when the Bloom filter is initialized.
 * This is used to balance the use of memory against the final false positive
 * rate.
 *
 * The implementation is well suited to data synchronization problems between
 * unordered sets, especially where predictable performance is important and
 * some false positives are acceptable.  It's also well suited to cache
 * filtering problems where a relatively small and/or low cardinality set is
 * fingerprinted, especially when many subsequent membership tests end up
 * indicating that values of interest are not present.  That should save the
 * caller many authoritative lookups, such as expensive probes of a much larger
 * on-disk structure.

 * Create Bloom filter in caller's memory context.  We aim for a false positive
 * rate of between 1% and 2% when bitset size is not constrained by memory
 * availability.
 *
 * total_elems is an estimate of the final size of the set.  It should be
 * approximately correct, but the implementation can cope well with it being
 * off by perhaps a factor of five or more.  See "Bloom Filters in
 * Probabilistic Verification" (Dillinger & Manolios, 2004) for details of why
 * this is the case.
 *
 * bloom_work_mem is sized in KB, in line with the general work_mem convention.
 * This determines the size of the underlying bitset (trivial bookkeeping space
 * isn't counted).  The bitset is always sized as a power of two number of
 * bits, and the largest possible bitset is 512MB (2^32 bits).  The
 * implementation allocates only enough memory to target its standard false
 * positive rate, using a simple formula with caller's total_elems estimate as
 * an input.  The bitset might be as small as 1MB, even when bloom_work_mem is
 * much higher.
 *
 * The Bloom filter is seeded using a value provided by the caller.  Using a
 * distinct seed value on every call makes it unlikely that the same false
 * positives will reoccur when the same set is fingerprinted a second time.
 * Callers that don't care about this pass a constant as their seed, typically
 * 0.  Callers can also use a pseudo-random seed, eg from pg_prng_uint64().
