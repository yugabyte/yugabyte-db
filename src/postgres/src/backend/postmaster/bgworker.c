/*
 * BackgroundWorkerSlots exist in shared memory and can be accessed (via
 * the BackgroundWorkerArray) by both the postmaster and by regular backends.
 * However, the postmaster cannot take locks, even spinlocks, because this
 * might allow it to crash or become wedged if shared memory gets corrupted.
 * Such an outcome is intolerable.  Therefore, we need a lockless protocol
 * for coordinating access to this data.
 *
 * The 'in_use' flag is used to hand off responsibility for the slot between
 * the postmaster and the rest of the system.  When 'in_use' is false,
 * the postmaster will ignore the slot entirely, except for the 'in_use' flag
 * itself, which it may read.  In this state, regular backends may modify the
 * slot.  Once a backend sets 'in_use' to true, the slot becomes the
 * responsibility of the postmaster.  Regular backends may no longer modify it,
 * but the postmaster may examine it.  Thus, a backend initializing a slot
 * must fully initialize the slot - and insert a write memory barrier - before
 * marking it as in use.
 *
 * As an exception, however, even when the slot is in use, regular backends
 * may set the 'terminate' flag for a slot, telling the postmaster not
 * to restart it.  Once the background worker is no longer running, the slot
 * will be released for reuse.
 *
 * In addition to coordinating with the postmaster, backends modifying this
 * data structure must coordinate with each other.  Since they can take locks,
 * this is straightforward: any backend wishing to manipulate a slot must
 * take BackgroundWorkerLock in exclusive mode.  Backends wishing to read
 * data that might get concurrently modified by other backends should take
 * this lock in shared mode.  No matter what, backends reading this data
 * structure must be able to tolerate concurrent modifications by the
 * postmaster.
