 *
 * checkpointer.c
 *
 * The checkpointer is new as of Postgres 9.2.  It handles all checkpoints.
 * Checkpoints are automatically dispatched after a certain amount of time has
 * elapsed since the last one, and it can be signaled to perform requested
 * checkpoints as well.  (The GUC parameter that mandates a checkpoint every
 * so many WAL segments is implemented by having backends signal when they
 * fill WAL segments; the checkpointer itself doesn't watch for the
 * condition.)
 *
 * Normal termination is by SIGUSR2, which instructs the checkpointer to
 * execute a shutdown checkpoint and then exit(0).  (All backends must be
 * stopped before SIGUSR2 is issued!)  Emergency termination is by SIGQUIT;
 * like any backend, the checkpointer will simply abort and exit on SIGQUIT.
 *
 * If the checkpointer exits unexpectedly, the postmaster treats that the same
 * as a backend crash: shared memory may be corrupted, so remaining backends
 * should be killed by SIGQUIT and then a recovery cycle started.  (Even if
 * shared memory isn't corrupted, we have lost information about which
 * files need to be fsync'd for the next checkpoint, and so a system
 * restart needs to be forced.)

/*----------
 * Shared memory area for communication between checkpointer and backends
 *
 * The ckpt counters allow backends to watch for completion of a checkpoint
 * request they send.  Here's how it works:
 *	* At start of a checkpoint, checkpointer reads (and clears) the request
 *	  flags and increments ckpt_started, while holding ckpt_lck.
 *	* On completion of a checkpoint, checkpointer sets ckpt_done to
 *	  equal ckpt_started.
 *	* On failure of a checkpoint, checkpointer increments ckpt_failed
 *	  and sets ckpt_done to equal ckpt_started.
 *
 * The algorithm for backends is:
 *	1. Record current values of ckpt_failed and ckpt_started, and
 *	   set request flags, while holding ckpt_lck.
 *	2. Send signal to request checkpoint.
 *	3. Sleep until ckpt_started changes.  Now you know a checkpoint has
 *	   begun since you started this algorithm (although *not* that it was
 *	   specifically initiated by your signal), and that it is using your flags.
 *	4. Record new value of ckpt_started.
 *	5. Sleep until ckpt_done >= saved value of ckpt_started.  (Use modulo
 *	   arithmetic here in case counters wrap around.)  Now you know a
 *	   checkpoint has started and completed, but not whether it was
 *	   successful.
 *	6. If ckpt_failed is different from the originally saved value,
 *	   assume request failed; otherwise it was definitely successful.
 *
 * ckpt_flags holds the OR of the checkpoint request flags sent by all
 * requesting backends since the last checkpoint start.  The flags are
 * chosen so that OR'ing is the correct way to combine multiple requests.
 *
 * num_backend_writes is used to count the number of buffer writes performed
 * by user backend processes.  This counter should be wide enough that it
 * can't overflow during a single processing cycle.  num_backend_fsync
 * counts the subset of those writes that also had to do their own fsync,
 * because the checkpointer failed to absorb their request.
 *
 * The requests array holds fsync requests sent by backends and not yet
 * absorbed by the checkpointer.
 *
 * Unlike the checkpoint fields, num_backend_writes, num_backend_fsync, and
 * the requests fields are protected by CheckpointerCommLock.
