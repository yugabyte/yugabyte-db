 *
 * autovacuum.c
 *
 * PostgreSQL Integrated Autovacuum Daemon
 *
 * The autovacuum system is structured in two different kinds of processes: the
 * autovacuum launcher and the autovacuum worker.  The launcher is an
 * always-running process, started by the postmaster when the autovacuum GUC
 * parameter is set.  The launcher schedules autovacuum workers to be started
 * when appropriate.  The workers are the processes which execute the actual
 * vacuuming; they connect to a database as determined in the launcher, and
 * once connected they examine the catalogs to select the tables to vacuum.
 *
 * The autovacuum launcher cannot start the worker processes by itself,
 * because doing so would cause robustness issues (namely, failure to shut
 * them down on exceptional conditions, and also, since the launcher is
 * connected to shared memory and is thus subject to corruption there, it is
 * not as robust as the postmaster).  So it leaves that task to the postmaster.
 *
 * There is an autovacuum shared memory area, where the launcher stores
 * information about the database it wants vacuumed.  When it wants a new
 * worker to start, it sets a flag in shared memory and sends a signal to the
 * postmaster.  Then postmaster knows nothing more than it must start a worker;
 * so it forks a new child, which turns into a worker.  This new process
 * connects to shared memory, and there it can inspect the information that the
 * launcher has set up.
 *
 * If the fork() call fails in the postmaster, it sets a flag in the shared
 * memory area, and sends a signal to the launcher.  The launcher, upon
 * noticing the flag, can try starting the worker again by resending the
 * signal.  Note that the failure can only be transient (fork failure due to
 * high load, memory pressure, too many processes, etc); more permanent
 * problems, like failure to connect to a database, are detected later in the
 * worker and dealt with just by having the worker exit normally.  The launcher
 * will launch a new worker again later, per schedule.
 *
 * When the worker is done vacuuming it sends SIGUSR2 to the launcher.  The
 * launcher then wakes up and is able to launch another worker, if the schedule
 * is so tight that a new worker is needed immediately.  At this time the
 * launcher can also balance the settings for the various remaining workers'
 * cost-based vacuum delay feature.
 *
 * Note that there can be more than one worker in a database concurrently.
 * They will store the table they are currently vacuuming in shared memory, so
 * that other workers avoid being blocked waiting for the vacuum lock for that
 * table.  They will also fetch the last time the table was vacuumed from
 * pgstats just before vacuuming each table, to avoid vacuuming a table that
 * was just finished being vacuumed by another worker and thus is no longer
 * noted in shared memory.  However, there is a small window (due to not yet
 * holding the relation lock) during which a worker may choose a table that was
 * already vacuumed; this is a bug in the current design.
