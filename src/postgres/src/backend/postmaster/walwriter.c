 *
 * walwriter.c
 *
 * The WAL writer background process is new as of Postgres 8.3.  It attempts
 * to keep regular backends from having to write out (and fsync) WAL pages.
 * Also, it guarantees that transaction commit records that weren't synced
 * to disk immediately upon commit (ie, were "asynchronously committed")
 * will reach disk within a knowable time --- which, as it happens, is at
 * most three times the wal_writer_delay cycle time.
 *
 * Note that as with the bgwriter for shared buffers, regular backends are
 * still empowered to issue WAL writes and fsyncs when the walwriter doesn't
 * keep up. This means that the WALWriter is not an essential process and
 * can shutdown quickly when requested.
 *
 * Because the walwriter's cycle is directly linked to the maximum delay
 * before async-commit transactions are guaranteed committed, it's probably
 * unwise to load additional functionality onto it.  For instance, if you've
 * got a yen to create xlog segments further in advance, that'd be better done
 * in bgwriter than in walwriter.
 *
 * The walwriter is started by the postmaster as soon as the startup subprocess
 * finishes.  It remains alive until the postmaster commands it to terminate.
 * Normal termination is by SIGTERM, which instructs the walwriter to exit(0).
 * Emergency termination is by SIGQUIT; like any backend, the walwriter will
 * simply abort and exit on SIGQUIT.
 *
 * If the walwriter exits unexpectedly, the postmaster treats that the same
 * as a backend crash: shared memory may be corrupted, so remaining backends
 * should be killed by SIGQUIT and then a recovery cycle started.
