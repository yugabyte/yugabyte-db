/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * parse_collate.c
 *		Routines for assigning collation information.
 *
 * We choose to handle collation analysis in a post-pass over the output
 * of expression parse analysis.  This is because we need more state to
 * perform this processing than is needed in the finished tree.  If we
 * did it on-the-fly while building the tree, all that state would have
 * to be kept in expression node trees permanently.  This way, the extra
 * storage is just local variables in this recursive routine.
 *
 * The info that is actually saved in the finished tree is:
 * 1. The output collation of each expression node, or InvalidOid if it
 * returns a noncollatable data type.  This can also be InvalidOid if the
 * result type is collatable but the collation is indeterminate.
 * 2. The collation to be used in executing each function.  InvalidOid means
 * that there are no collatable inputs or their collation is indeterminate.
 * This value is only stored in node types that might call collation-using
 * functions.
 *
 * You might think we could get away with storing only one collation per
 * node, but the two concepts really need to be kept distinct.  Otherwise
 * it's too confusing when a function produces a collatable output type but
 * has no collatable inputs or produces noncollatable output from collatable
 * inputs.
 *
 * Cases with indeterminate collation might result in an error being thrown
 * at runtime.  If we knew exactly which functions require collation
 * information, we could throw those errors at parse time instead.
