/*----------
 * Operator selectivity estimation functions are called to estimate the
 * selectivity of WHERE clauses whose top-level operator is their operator.
 * We divide the problem into two cases:
 *		Restriction clause estimation: the clause involves vars of just
 *			one relation.
 *		Join clause estimation: the clause involves vars of multiple rels.
 * Join selectivity estimation is far more difficult and usually less accurate
 * than restriction estimation.
 *
 * When dealing with the inner scan of a nestloop join, we consider the
 * join's joinclauses as restriction clauses for the inner relation, and
 * treat vars of the outer relation as parameters (a/k/a constants of unknown
 * values).  So, restriction estimators need to be able to accept an argument
 * telling which relation is to be treated as the variable.
 *
 * The call convention for a restriction estimator (oprrest function) is
 *
 *		Selectivity oprrest (PlannerInfo *root,
 *							 Oid operator,
 *							 List *args,
 *							 int varRelid);
 *
 * root: general information about the query (rtable and RelOptInfo lists
 * are particularly important for the estimator).
 * operator: OID of the specific operator in question.
 * args: argument list from the operator clause.
 * varRelid: if not zero, the relid (rtable index) of the relation to
 * be treated as the variable relation.  May be zero if the args list
 * is known to contain vars of only one relation.
 *
 * This is represented at the SQL level (in pg_proc) as
 *
 *		float8 oprrest (internal, oid, internal, int4);
 *
 * The result is a selectivity, that is, a fraction (0 to 1) of the rows
 * of the relation that are expected to produce a TRUE result for the
 * given operator.
 *
 * The call convention for a join estimator (oprjoin function) is similar
 * except that varRelid is not needed, and instead join information is
 * supplied:
 *
 *		Selectivity oprjoin (PlannerInfo *root,
 *							 Oid operator,
 *							 List *args,
 *							 JoinType jointype,
 *							 SpecialJoinInfo *sjinfo);
 *
 *		float8 oprjoin (internal, oid, internal, int2, internal);
 *
 * (Before Postgres 8.4, join estimators had only the first four of these
 * parameters.  That signature is still allowed, but deprecated.)  The
 * relationship between jointype and sjinfo is explained in the comments for
 * clause_selectivity() --- the short version is that jointype is usually
 * best ignored in favor of examining sjinfo.
 *
 * Join selectivity for regular inner and outer joins is defined as the
 * fraction (0 to 1) of the cross product of the relations that is expected
 * to produce a TRUE result for the given operator.  For both semi and anti
 * joins, however, the selectivity is defined as the fraction of the left-hand
 * side relation's rows that are expected to have a match (ie, at least one
 * row with a TRUE result) in the right-hand side.
 *
 * For both oprrest and oprjoin functions, the operator's input collation OID
 * (if any) is passed using the standard fmgr mechanism, so that the estimator
 * function can fetch it with PG_GET_COLLATION().  Note, however, that all
 * statistics in pg_statistic are currently built using the relevant column's
 * collation.

/*
 * estimate_num_groups		- Estimate number of groups in a grouped query
 *
 * Given a query having a GROUP BY clause, estimate how many groups there
 * will be --- ie, the number of distinct combinations of the GROUP BY
 * expressions.
 *
 * This routine is also used to estimate the number of rows emitted by
 * a DISTINCT filtering step; that is an isomorphic problem.  (Note:
 * actually, we only use it for DISTINCT when there's no grouping or
 * aggregation ahead of the DISTINCT.)
 *
 * Inputs:
 *	root - the query
 *	groupExprs - list of expressions being grouped by
 *	input_rows - number of rows estimated to arrive at the group/unique
 *		filter step
 *	pgset - NULL, or a List** pointing to a grouping set to filter the
 *		groupExprs against
 *
 * Outputs:
 *	estinfo - When passed as non-NULL, the function will set bits in the
 *		"flags" field in order to provide callers with additional information
 *		about the estimation.  Currently, we only set the SELFLAG_USED_DEFAULT
 *		bit if we used any default values in the estimation.
 *
 * Given the lack of any cross-correlation statistics in the system, it's
 * impossible to do anything really trustworthy with GROUP BY conditions
 * involving multiple Vars.  We should however avoid assuming the worst
 * case (all possible cross-product terms actually appear as groups) since
 * very often the grouped-by Vars are highly correlated.  Our current approach
 * is as follows:
 *	1.  Expressions yielding boolean are assumed to contribute two groups,
 *		independently of their content, and are ignored in the subsequent
 *		steps.  This is mainly because tests like "col IS NULL" break the
 *		heuristic used in step 2 especially badly.
 *	2.  Reduce the given expressions to a list of unique Vars used.  For
 *		example, GROUP BY a, a + b is treated the same as GROUP BY a, b.
 *		It is clearly correct not to count the same Var more than once.
 *		It is also reasonable to treat f(x) the same as x: f() cannot
 *		increase the number of distinct values (unless it is volatile,
 *		which we consider unlikely for grouping), but it probably won't
 *		reduce the number of distinct values much either.
 *		As a special case, if a GROUP BY expression can be matched to an
 *		expressional index for which we have statistics, then we treat the
 *		whole expression as though it were just a Var.
 *	3.  If the list contains Vars of different relations that are known equal
 *		due to equivalence classes, then drop all but one of the Vars from each
 *		known-equal set, keeping the one with smallest estimated # of values
 *		(since the extra values of the others can't appear in joined rows).
 *		Note the reason we only consider Vars of different relations is that
 *		if we considered ones of the same rel, we'd be double-counting the
 *		restriction selectivity of the equality in the next step.
 *	4.  For Vars within a single source rel, we multiply together the numbers
 *		of values, clamp to the number of rows in the rel (divided by 10 if
 *		more than one Var), and then multiply by a factor based on the
 *		selectivity of the restriction clauses for that rel.  When there's
 *		more than one Var, the initial product is probably too high (it's the
 *		worst case) but clamping to a fraction of the rel's rows seems to be a
 *		helpful heuristic for not letting the estimate get out of hand.  (The
 *		factor of 10 is derived from pre-Postgres-7.4 practice.)  The factor
 *		we multiply by to adjust for the restriction selectivity assumes that
 *		the restriction clauses are independent of the grouping, which may not
 *		be a valid assumption, but it's hard to do better.
 *	5.  If there are Vars from multiple rels, we repeat step 4 for each such
 *		rel, and multiply the results together.
 * Note that rels not containing grouped Vars are ignored completely, as are
 * join clauses.  Such rels cannot increase the number of groups, and we
 * assume such clauses do not reduce the number either (somewhat bogus,
 * but we don't have the info to do better).

 * smart enough to figure out how the restrict clauses might change the
 * distribution, so this will have to do for now.
 *
 * We are passed the number of buckets the executor will use for the given
 * input relation.  If the data were perfectly distributed, with the same
 * number of tuples going into each available bucket, then the bucketsize
 * fraction would be 1/nbuckets.  But this happy state of affairs will occur

 * be nonuniformly occupied.  If the other relation in the join has a key
 * distribution similar to this one's, then the most-loaded buckets are
 * exactly those that will be probed most often.  Therefore, the "average"
 * bucket size for costing purposes should really be taken as something close
 * to the "worst case" bucket size.  We try to estimate this by adjusting the
 * fraction if there are too few distinct data values, and then scaling up
 * by the ratio of the most common value's frequency to the average frequency.
 *

	 * We use the index-only-scan machinery for this.  With mostly-static
	 * tables that's a win because it avoids a heap visit.  It's also a win
	 * for dynamic data, but the reason is less obvious; read on for details.
	 *
	 * In principle, we should scan the index with our current active
	 * snapshot, which is the best approximation we've got to what the query
	 * will see when executed.  But that won't be exact if a new snap is taken
	 * before running the query, and it can be very expensive if a lot of
	 * recently-dead or uncommitted rows exist at the beginning or end of the
	 * index (because we'll laboriously fetch each one and reject it).
	 * Instead, we use SnapshotNonVacuumable.  That will accept recently-dead
	 * and uncommitted rows as well as normal visible rows.  On the other
	 * hand, it will reject known-dead rows, and thus not give a bogus answer
	 * when the extreme value has been deleted (unless the deletion was quite
	 * recent); that case motivates not using SnapshotAny here.
	 *
	 * A crucial point here is that SnapshotNonVacuumable, with
	 * GlobalVisTestFor(heapRel) as horizon, yields the inverse of the
	 * condition that the indexscan will use to decide that index entries are
	 * killable (see heap_hot_search_buffer()).  Therefore, if the snapshot
	 * rejects a tuple (or more precisely, all tuples of a HOT chain) and we
	 * have to continue scanning past it, we know that the indexscan will mark
	 * that index entry killed.  That means that the next
	 * get_actual_variable_endpoint() call will not have to re-consider that
	 * index entry.  In this way we avoid repetitive work when this function
	 * is used a lot during planning.
	 *
	 * But using SnapshotNonVacuumable creates a hazard of its own.  In a
	 * recently-created index, some index entries may point at "broken" HOT
	 * chains in which not all the tuple versions contain data matching the
	 * index entry.  The live tuple version(s) certainly do match the index,
	 * but SnapshotNonVacuumable can accept recently-dead tuple versions that
	 * don't match.  Hence, if we took data from the selected heap tuple, we
	 * might get a bogus answer that's not close to the index extremal value,
	 * or could even be NULL.  We avoid this hazard because we take the data
	 * from the index entry not the heap.
	 *
	 * Despite all this care, there are situations where we might find many
	 * non-visible tuples near the end of the index.  We don't want to expend
	 * a huge amount of time here, so we give up once we've read too many heap
	 * pages.  When we fail for that reason, the caller will end up using
	 * whatever extremal value is recorded in pg_statistic.
