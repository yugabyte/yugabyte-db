 *
 * logtape.c
 *	  Management of "logical tapes" within temporary files.
 *
 * This module exists to support sorting via multiple merge passes (see
 * tuplesort.c).  Merging is an ideal algorithm for tape devices, but if
 * we implement it on disk by creating a separate file for each "tape",
 * there is an annoying problem: the peak space usage is at least twice
 * the volume of actual data to be sorted.  (This must be so because each
 * datum will appear in both the input and output tapes of the final
 * merge pass.)
 *
 * We can work around this problem by recognizing that any one tape
 * dataset (with the possible exception of the final output) is written
 * and read exactly once in a perfectly sequential manner.  Therefore,
 * a datum once read will not be required again, and we can recycle its
 * space for use by the new tape dataset(s) being generated.  In this way,
 * the total space usage is essentially just the actual data volume, plus
 * insignificant bookkeeping and start/stop overhead.
 *
 * Few OSes allow arbitrary parts of a file to be released back to the OS,
 * so we have to implement this space-recycling ourselves within a single
 * logical file.  logtape.c exists to perform this bookkeeping and provide
 * the illusion of N independent tape devices to tuplesort.c.  Note that
 * logtape.c itself depends on buffile.c to provide a "logical file" of
 * larger size than the underlying OS may support.
 *
 * For simplicity, we allocate and release space in the underlying file
 * in BLCKSZ-size blocks.  Space allocation boils down to keeping track
 * of which blocks in the underlying file belong to which logical tape,
 * plus any blocks that are free (recycled and not yet reused).
 * The blocks in each logical tape form a chain, with a prev- and next-
 * pointer in each block.
 *
 * The initial write pass is guaranteed to fill the underlying file
 * perfectly sequentially, no matter how data is divided into logical tapes.
 * Once we begin merge passes, the access pattern becomes considerably
 * less predictable --- but the seeking involved should be comparable to
 * what would happen if we kept each logical tape in a separate file,
 * so there's no serious performance penalty paid to obtain the space
 * savings of recycling.  We try to localize the write accesses by always
 * writing to the lowest-numbered free block when we have a choice; it's
 * not clear this helps much, but it can't hurt.  (XXX perhaps a LIFO
 * policy for free blocks would be better?)
 *
 * To further make the I/Os more sequential, we can use a larger buffer
 * when reading, and read multiple blocks from the same tape in one go,
 * whenever the buffer becomes empty.
 *
 * To support the above policy of writing to the lowest free block, the
 * freelist is a min heap.
 *
 * Since all the bookkeeping and buffer memory is allocated with palloc(),
 * and the underlying file(s) are made with OpenTemporaryFile, all resources
 * for a logical tape set are certain to be cleaned up even if processing
 * is aborted by ereport(ERROR).  To avoid confusion, the caller should take
 * care that all calls for a single LogicalTapeSet are made in the same
 * palloc context.
 *
 * To support parallel sort operations involving coordinated callers to
 * tuplesort.c routines across multiple workers, it is necessary to
 * concatenate each worker BufFile/tapeset into one single logical tapeset
 * managed by the leader.  Workers should have produced one final
 * materialized tape (their entire output) when this happens in leader.
 * There will always be the same number of runs as input tapes, and the same
 * number of input tapes as participants (worker Tuplesortstates).
