 *
 * tuplestore.c
 *	  Generalized routines for temporary tuple storage.
 *
 * This module handles temporary storage of tuples for purposes such
 * as Materialize nodes, hashjoin batch files, etc.  It is essentially
 * a dumbed-down version of tuplesort.c; it does no sorting of tuples
 * but can only store and regurgitate a sequence of tuples.  However,
 * because no sort is required, it is allowed to start reading the sequence
 * before it has all been written.  This is particularly useful for cursors,
 * because it allows random access within the already-scanned portion of
 * a query without having to process the underlying scan to completion.
 * Also, it is possible to support multiple independent read pointers.
 *
 * A temporary file is used to handle the data if it exceeds the
 * space limit specified by the caller.
 *
 * The (approximate) amount of memory allowed to the tuplestore is specified
 * in kilobytes by the caller.  We absorb tuples and simply store them in an
 * in-memory array as long as we haven't exceeded maxKBytes.  If we do exceed
 * maxKBytes, we dump all the tuples into a temp file and then read from that
 * when needed.
 *
 * Upon creation, a tuplestore supports a single read pointer, numbered 0.
 * Additional read pointers can be created using tuplestore_alloc_read_pointer.
 * Mark/restore behavior is supported by copying read pointers.
 *
 * When the caller requests backward-scan capability, we write the temp file
 * in a format that allows either forward or backward scan.  Otherwise, only
 * forward scan is allowed.  A request for backward scan must be made before
 * putting any tuples into the tuplestore.  Rewind is normally allowed but
 * can be turned off via tuplestore_set_eflags; turning off rewind for all
 * read pointers enables truncation of the tuplestore at the oldest read point
 * for minimal memory usage.  (The caller must explicitly call tuplestore_trim
 * at appropriate times for truncation to actually happen.)
 *
 * Note: in TSS_WRITEFILE state, the temp file's seek position is the
 * current write position, and the write-position variables in the tuplestore
 * aren't kept up to date.  Similarly, in TSS_READFILE state the temp file's
 * seek position is the active read pointer's position, and that read pointer
 * isn't kept up to date.  We update the appropriate variables using ftell()
 * before switching to the other state or activating a different read pointer.

/*--------------------
 *
 * NOTES about on-tape representation of tuples:
 *
 * We require the first "unsigned int" of a stored tuple to be the total size
 * on-tape of the tuple, including itself (so it is never zero).
 * The remainder of the stored tuple
 * may or may not match the in-memory representation of the tuple ---
 * any conversion needed is the job of the writetup and readtup routines.
 *
 * If state->backward is true, then the stored representation of
 * the tuple must be followed by another "unsigned int" that is a copy of the
 * length --- so the total tape space used is actually sizeof(unsigned int)
 * more than the stored length value.  This allows read-backwards.  When
 * state->backward is not set, the write/read routines may omit the extra
 * length word.
 *
 * writetup is expected to write both length words as well as the tuple
 * data.  When readtup is called, the tape is positioned just after the
 * front length word; readtup must read the tuple data and advance past
 * the back length word (if present).
 *
 * The write/read routines can make use of the tuple description data
 * stored in the Tuplestorestate record, if needed. They are also expected
 * to adjust state->availMem by the amount of memory space (not tape space!)
 * released or consumed.  There is no error return from either writetup
 * or readtup; they should ereport() on failure.
 *
 *
 * NOTES about memory consumption calculations:
 *
 * We count space allocated for tuples against the maxKBytes limit,
 * plus the space used by the variable-size array memtuples.
 * Fixed-size space (primarily the BufFile I/O buffer) is not counted.
 * We don't worry about the size of the read pointer array, either.
 *
 * Note that we count actual space used (as shown by GetMemoryChunkSpace)
 * rather than the originally-requested size.  This is important since
 * palloc can add substantial overhead.  It's not a complete answer since
 * we won't count any wasted space in palloc allocation blocks, but it's
 * a lot better than what we were doing before 7.3.
