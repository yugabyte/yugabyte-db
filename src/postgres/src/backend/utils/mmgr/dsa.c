 * dsa.c
 *	  Dynamic shared memory areas.
 *
 * This module provides dynamic shared memory areas which are built on top of
 * DSM segments.  While dsm.c allows segments of memory of shared memory to be
 * created and shared between backends, it isn't designed to deal with small
 * objects.  A DSA area is a shared memory heap usually backed by one or more
 * DSM segments which can allocate memory using dsa_allocate() and dsa_free().
 * Alternatively, it can be created in pre-existing shared memory, including a
 * DSM segment, and then create extra DSM segments as required.  Unlike the
 * regular system heap, it deals in pseudo-pointers which must be converted to
 * backend-local pointers before they are dereferenced.  These pseudo-pointers
 * can however be shared with other backends, and can be used to construct
 * shared data structures.
 *
 * Each DSA area manages a set of DSM segments, adding new segments as
 * required and detaching them when they are no longer needed.  Each segment
 * contains a number of 4KB pages, a free page manager for tracking
 * consecutive runs of free pages, and a page map for tracking the source of
 * objects allocated on each page.  Allocation requests above 8KB are handled
 * by choosing a segment and finding consecutive free pages in its free page
 * manager.  Allocation requests for smaller sizes are handled using pools of
 * objects of a selection of sizes.  Each pool consists of a number of 16 page
 * (64KB) superblocks allocated in the same way as large objects.  Allocation
 * of large objects and new superblocks is serialized by a single LWLock, but
 * allocation of small objects from pre-existing superblocks uses one LWLock
 * per pool.  Currently there is one pool, and therefore one lock, per size
 * class.  Per-core pools to increase concurrency and strategies for reducing
 * the resulting fragmentation are areas for future research.  Each superblock
 * is managed with a 'span', which tracks the superblock's freelist.  Free
 * requests are handled by looking in the page map to find which span an
 * address was allocated from, so that small objects can be returned to the
 * appropriate free list, and large object pages can be returned directly to
 * the free page map.  When allocating, simple heuristics for selecting
 * segments and superblocks try to encourage occupied memory to be
 * concentrated, increasing the likelihood that whole superblocks can become
 * empty and be returned to the free page manager, and whole segments can
 * become empty and be returned to the operating system.

 *
 * NB: The optimal spacing for size classes, as well as the size of the blocks

 * right answer.  Some allocators (such as tcmalloc) use more closely-spaced
