 * check_enable_rls
 *
 * Determine, based on the relation, row_security setting, and current role,
 * if RLS is applicable to this query.  RLS_NONE_ENV indicates that, while
 * RLS is not to be added for this query, a change in the environment may change
 * that.  RLS_NONE means that RLS is not on the relation at all and therefore
 * we don't need to worry about it.  RLS_ENABLED means RLS should be implemented
 * for the table and the plan cache needs to be invalidated if the environment
 * changes.
 *
 * Handle checking as another role via checkAsUser (for views, etc).  Pass
 * InvalidOid to check the current user.
 *
 * If noError is set to 'true' then we just return RLS_ENABLED instead of doing
 * an ereport() if the user has attempted to bypass RLS and they are not
 * allowed to.  This allows users to check if RLS is enabled without having to
 * deal with the actual error case (eg: error cases which are trying to decide
 * if the user should get data from the relation back as part of the error).
