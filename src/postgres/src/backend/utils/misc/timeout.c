		 *
		 * Because we didn't bother to disable the timer in disable_alarm(),

		 * This will mean that the timer fires a little later than we
		 * intended, but only by the amount of time it takes for the signal
		 * handler to do nothing useful, which shouldn't be much.
		 *
		 * 2. The signal handler executes and removes one or more timeout
		 * events.  When it returns, either the queue is now empty or the
		 * frontmost event is later than the one we looked at above.  So we'll
		 * overwrite the timer value with one that is too soon (plus or minus
		 * the signal handler's execution time), causing a useless interrupt
		 * to occur.  But the handler will then re-set the timer and
		 * everything will still work as expected.
		 *
		 * Since these cases are of very low probability (the window here
		 * being quite narrow), it's not worth adding cycles to the mainline
		 * code to prevent occasional wasted interrupts.

		 * If there is already an interrupt pending that's at or before the

		 * for later in the second case.  It might seem that the extra
		 * interrupt is wasted work, but it's not terribly much work, and this
		 * method has very significant advantages in the common use-case where
		 * we repeatedly set a timeout that we don't expect to reach and then
		 * cancel it.  Instead of invoking setitimer() every time the timeout
		 * is set or canceled, we perform one interrupt and a re-scheduling
		 * setitimer() call at intervals roughly equal to the timeout delay.
		 * For example, with statement_timeout = 1s and a throughput of
		 * thousands of queries per second, this method requires an interrupt
		 * and setitimer() call roughly once a second, rather than thousands
		 * of setitimer() calls per second.
		 *
		 * Because of the possible passage of time between when we obtained
		 * "now" and when we reach setitimer(), the kernel's opinion of when
		 * to trigger the interrupt is likely to be a bit later than
		 * signal_due_at.  That's fine, for the same reasons described above.
