 *
 * inval.c
 *	  POSTGRES cache invalidation dispatcher code.
 *
 *	This is subtle stuff, so pay attention:
 *
 *	When a tuple is updated or deleted, our standard visibility rules
 *	consider that it is *still valid* so long as we are in the same command,
 *	ie, until the next CommandCounterIncrement() or transaction commit.
 *	(See access/heap/heapam_visibility.c, and note that system catalogs are
 *  generally scanned under the most current snapshot available, rather than
 *  the transaction snapshot.)	At the command boundary, the old tuple stops
 *	being valid and the new version, if any, becomes valid.  Therefore,
 *	we cannot simply flush a tuple from the system caches during heap_update()
 *	or heap_delete().  The tuple is still good at that point; what's more,
 *	even if we did flush it, it might be reloaded into the caches by a later
 *	request in the same command.  So the correct behavior is to keep a list
 *	of outdated (updated/deleted) tuples and then do the required cache
 *	flushes at the next command boundary.  We must also keep track of
 *	inserted tuples so that we can flush "negative" cache entries that match
 *	the new tuples; again, that mustn't happen until end of command.
 *
 *	Once we have finished the command, we still need to remember inserted
 *	tuples (including new versions of updated tuples), so that we can flush
 *	them from the caches if we abort the transaction.  Similarly, we'd better
 *	be able to flush "negative" cache entries that may have been loaded in
 *	place of deleted tuples, so we still need the deleted ones too.
 *
 *	If we successfully complete the transaction, we have to broadcast all
 *	these invalidation events to other backends (via the SI message queue)
 *	so that they can flush obsolete entries from their caches.  Note we have
 *	to record the transaction commit before sending SI messages, otherwise
 *	the other backends won't see our updated tuples as good.
 *
 *	When a subtransaction aborts, we can process and discard any events
 *	it has queued.  When a subtransaction commits, we just add its events
 *	to the pending lists of the parent transaction.
 *
 *	In short, we need to remember until xact end every insert or delete
 *	of a tuple that might be in the system caches.  Updates are treated as
 *	two events, delete + insert, for simplicity.  (If the update doesn't
 *	change the tuple hash value, catcache.c optimizes this into one event.)
 *
 *	We do not need to register EVERY tuple operation in this way, just those
 *	on tuples in relations that have associated catcaches.  We do, however,
 *	have to register every operation on every tuple that *could* be in a
 *	catcache, whether or not it currently is in our cache.  Also, if the
 *	tuple is in a relation that has multiple catcaches, we need to register
 *	an invalidation message for each such catcache.  catcache.c's
 *	PrepareToInvalidateCacheTuple() routine provides the knowledge of which
 *	catcaches may need invalidation for a given tuple.
 *
 *	Also, whenever we see an operation on a pg_class, pg_attribute, or
 *	pg_index tuple, we register a relcache flush operation for the relation
 *	described by that tuple (as specified in CacheInvalidateHeapTuple()).
 *	Likewise for pg_constraint tuples for foreign keys on relations.
 *
 *	We keep the relcache flush requests in lists separate from the catcache
 *	tuple flush requests.  This allows us to issue all the pending catcache
 *	flushes before we issue relcache flushes, which saves us from loading
 *	a catcache tuple during relcache load only to flush it again right away.
 *	Also, we avoid queuing multiple relcache flush requests for the same
 *	relation, since a relcache flush is relatively expensive to do.
 *	(XXX is it worth testing likewise for duplicate catcache flush entries?
 *	Probably not.)
 *
 *	Many subsystems own higher-level caches that depend on relcache and/or
 *	catcache, and they register callbacks here to invalidate their caches.
 *	While building a higher-level cache entry, a backend may receive a
 *	callback for the being-built entry or one of its dependencies.  This
 *	implies the new higher-level entry would be born stale, and it might
 *	remain stale for the life of the backend.  Many caches do not prevent
 *	that.  They rely on DDL for can't-miss catalog changes taking
 *	AccessExclusiveLock on suitable objects.  (For a change made with less
 *	locking, backends might never read the change.)  The relation cache,
 *	however, needs to reflect changes from CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY no later
 *	than the beginning of the next transaction.  Hence, when a relevant
 *	invalidation callback arrives during a build, relcache.c reattempts that
 *	build.  Caches with similar needs could do likewise.
 *
 *	If a relcache flush is issued for a system relation that we preload
 *	from the relcache init file, we must also delete the init file so that
 *	it will be rebuilt during the next backend restart.  The actual work of
 *	manipulating the init file is in relcache.c, but we keep track of the
 *	need for it here.
 *
 *	Currently, inval messages are sent without regard for the possibility
 *	that the object described by the catalog tuple might be a session-local
 *	object such as a temporary table.  This is because (1) this code has
 *	no practical way to tell the difference, and (2) it is not certain that
 *	other backends don't have catalog cache or even relcache entries for
 *	such tables, anyway; there is nothing that prevents that.  It might be
 *	worth trying to avoid sending such inval traffic in the future, if those
 *	problems can be overcome cheaply.
 *
 *	When wal_level=logical, write invalidations into WAL at each command end to
 *	support the decoding of the in-progress transactions.  See
 *	CommandEndInvalidationMessages.

/*
 * Pending requests are stored as ready-to-send SharedInvalidationMessages.
 * We keep the messages themselves in arrays in TopTransactionContext
 * (there are separate arrays for catcache and relcache messages).  Control
 * information is kept in a chain of TransInvalidationInfo structs, also
 * allocated in TopTransactionContext.  (We could keep a subtransaction's
 * TransInvalidationInfo in its CurTransactionContext; but that's more
 * wasteful not less so, since in very many scenarios it'd be the only
 * allocation in the subtransaction's CurTransactionContext.)
 *
 * We can store the message arrays densely, and yet avoid moving data around
 * within an array, because within any one subtransaction we need only
 * distinguish between messages emitted by prior commands and those emitted
 * by the current command.  Once a command completes and we've done local
 * processing on its messages, we can fold those into the prior-commands
 * messages just by changing array indexes in the TransInvalidationInfo
 * struct.  Similarly, we need distinguish messages of prior subtransactions
 * from those of the current subtransaction only until the subtransaction
 * completes, after which we adjust the array indexes in the parent's
 * TransInvalidationInfo to include the subtransaction's messages.
 *
 * The ordering of the individual messages within a command's or
 * subtransaction's output is not considered significant, although this
 * implementation happens to preserve the order in which they were queued.
 * (Previous versions of this code did not preserve it.)
 *
 * For notational convenience, control information is kept in two-element
 * arrays, the first for catcache messages and the second for relcache
 * messages.
