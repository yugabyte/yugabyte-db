 *
 * s_lock.c
 *	   Hardware-dependent implementation of spinlocks.
 *
 * When waiting for a contended spinlock we loop tightly for awhile, then
 * delay using pg_usleep() and try again.  Preferably, "awhile" should be a
 * small multiple of the maximum time we expect a spinlock to be held.  100
 * iterations seems about right as an initial guess.  However, on a
 * uniprocessor the loop is a waste of cycles, while in a multi-CPU scenario
 * it's usually better to spin a bit longer than to call the kernel, so we try
 * to adapt the spin loop count depending on whether we seem to be in a
 * uniprocessor or multiprocessor.
 *
 * Note: you might think MIN_SPINS_PER_DELAY should be just 1, but you'd
 * be wrong; there are platforms where that can result in a "stuck
 * spinlock" failure.  This has been seen particularly on Alphas; it seems
 * that the first TAS after returning from kernel space will always fail
 * on that hardware.
 *
 * Once we do decide to block, we use randomly increasing pg_usleep()
 * delays. The first delay is 1 msec, then the delay randomly increases to
 * about one second, after which we reset to 1 msec and start again.  The
 * idea here is that in the presence of heavy contention we need to
 * increase the delay, else the spinlock holder may never get to run and
 * release the lock.  (Consider situation where spinlock holder has been
 * nice'd down in priority by the scheduler --- it will not get scheduled
 * until all would-be acquirers are sleeping, so if we always use a 1-msec
 * sleep, there is a real possibility of starvation.)  But we can't just
 * clamp the delay to an upper bound, else it would take a long time to
 * make a reasonable number of tries.
 *
 * We time out and declare error after NUM_DELAYS delays (thus, exactly
 * that many tries). With the given settings, this will usually take 30 or
 * so seconds (YB: this has been changed from 2 minutes). It seems better to
 * fix the total number of tries (and thus the probability of unintended
 * failure) than to fix the total time spent.
