 *	  Implementation of condition variables.  Condition variables provide
 *	  a way for one process to wait until a specific condition occurs,
 *	  without needing to know the specific identity of the process for
 *	  which they are waiting.  Waits for condition variables can be
 *	  interrupted, unlike LWLock waits.  Condition variables are safe
 *	  to use within dynamic shared memory segments.
