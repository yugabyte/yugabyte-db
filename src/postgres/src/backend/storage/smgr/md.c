/*
 *	The magnetic disk storage manager keeps track of open file
 *	descriptors in its own descriptor pool.  This is done to make it
 *	easier to support relations that are larger than the operating
 *	system's file size limit (often 2GBytes).  In order to do that,
 *	we break relations up into "segment" files that are each shorter than
 *	the OS file size limit.  The segment size is set by the RELSEG_SIZE
 *	configuration constant in pg_config.h.
 *
 *	On disk, a relation must consist of consecutively numbered segment
 *	files in the pattern
 *		-- Zero or more full segments of exactly RELSEG_SIZE blocks each
 *		-- Exactly one partial segment of size 0 <= size < RELSEG_SIZE blocks
 *		-- Optionally, any number of inactive segments of size 0 blocks.
 *	The full and partial segments are collectively the "active" segments.
 *	Inactive segments are those that once contained data but are currently
 *	not needed because of an mdtruncate() operation.  The reason for leaving
 *	them present at size zero, rather than unlinking them, is that other
 *	backends and/or the checkpointer might be holding open file references to
 *	such segments.  If the relation expands again after mdtruncate(), such
 *	that a deactivated segment becomes active again, it is important that
 *	such file references still be valid --- else data might get written
 *	out to an unlinked old copy of a segment file that will eventually
 *	disappear.
 *
 *	File descriptors are stored in the per-fork md_seg_fds arrays inside
 *	SMgrRelation. The length of these arrays is stored in md_num_open_segs.
 *	Note that a fork's md_num_open_segs having a specific value does not
 *	necessarily mean the relation doesn't have additional segments; we may
 *	just not have opened the next segment yet.  (We could not have "all
 *	segments are in the array" as an invariant anyway, since another backend
 *	could extend the relation while we aren't looking.)  We do not have
 *	entries for inactive segments, however; as soon as we find a partial
 *	segment, we assume that any subsequent segments are inactive.
 *
 *	The entire MdfdVec array is palloc'd in the MdCxt memory context.

/*
 *	mdunlink() -- Unlink a relation.
 *
 * Note that we're passed a RelFileNodeBackend --- by the time this is called,
 * there won't be an SMgrRelation hashtable entry anymore.
 *
 * forkNum can be a fork number to delete a specific fork, or InvalidForkNumber
 * to delete all forks.
 *
 * For regular relations, we don't unlink the first segment file of the rel,
 * but just truncate it to zero length, and record a request to unlink it after
 * the next checkpoint.  Additional segments can be unlinked immediately,
 * however.  Leaving the empty file in place prevents that relfilenode
 * number from being reused.  The scenario this protects us from is:
 * 1. We delete a relation (and commit, and actually remove its file).
 * 2. We create a new relation, which by chance gets the same relfilenode as
 *	  the just-deleted one (OIDs must've wrapped around for that to happen).
 * 3. We crash before another checkpoint occurs.
 * During replay, we would delete the file and then recreate it, which is fine
 * if the contents of the file were repopulated by subsequent WAL entries.
 * But if we didn't WAL-log insertions, but instead relied on fsyncing the
 * file after populating it (as we do at wal_level=minimal), the contents of
 * the file would be lost forever.  By leaving the empty file until after the
 * next checkpoint, we prevent reassignment of the relfilenode number until
 * it's safe, because relfilenode assignment skips over any existing file.
 *
 * Additional segments, if any, are truncated and then unlinked.  The reason
 * for truncating is that other backends may still hold open FDs for these at
 * the smgr level, so that the kernel can't remove the file yet.  We want to
 * reclaim the disk space right away despite that.
 *
 * We do not need to go through this dance for temp relations, though, because
 * we never make WAL entries for temp rels, and so a temp rel poses no threat
 * to the health of a regular rel that has taken over its relfilenode number.
 * The fact that temp rels and regular rels have different file naming
 * patterns provides additional safety.  Other backends shouldn't have open
 * FDs for them, either.
 *
 * We also don't do it while performing a binary upgrade.  There is no reuse
 * hazard in that case, since after a crash or even a simple ERROR, the
 * upgrade fails and the whole cluster must be recreated from scratch.
 * Furthermore, it is important to remove the files from disk immediately,
 * because we may be about to reuse the same relfilenode number.
 *
 * All the above applies only to the relation's main fork; other forks can
 * just be removed immediately, since they are not needed to prevent the
 * relfilenode number from being recycled.  Also, we do not carefully
 * track whether other forks have been created or not, but just attempt to
 * unlink them unconditionally; so we should never complain about ENOENT.
 *
 * If isRedo is true, it's unsurprising for the relation to be already gone.
 * Also, we should remove the file immediately instead of queuing a request
 * for later, since during redo there's no possibility of creating a
 * conflicting relation.
 *
 * Note: we currently just never warn about ENOENT at all.  We could warn in
 * the main-fork, non-isRedo case, but it doesn't seem worth the trouble.
 *
 * Note: any failure should be reported as WARNING not ERROR, because
 * we are usually not in a transaction anymore when this is called.
