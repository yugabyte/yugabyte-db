/*
 * Log details of the current snapshot to WAL. This allows the snapshot state
 * to be reconstructed on the standby and for logical decoding.
 *
 * This is used for Hot Standby as follows:
 *
 * We can move directly to STANDBY_SNAPSHOT_READY at startup if we
 * start from a shutdown checkpoint because we know nothing was running
 * at that time and our recovery snapshot is known empty. In the more
 * typical case of an online checkpoint we need to jump through a few
 * hoops to get a correct recovery snapshot and this requires a two or
 * sometimes a three stage process.
 *
 * The initial snapshot must contain all running xids and all current
 * AccessExclusiveLocks at a point in time on the standby. Assembling
 * that information while the server is running requires many and
 * various LWLocks, so we choose to derive that information piece by
 * piece and then re-assemble that info on the standby. When that
 * information is fully assembled we move to STANDBY_SNAPSHOT_READY.
 *
 * Since locking on the primary when we derive the information is not
 * strict, we note that there is a time window between the derivation and
 * writing to WAL of the derived information. That allows race conditions
 * that we must resolve, since xids and locks may enter or leave the
 * snapshot during that window. This creates the issue that an xid or
 * lock may start *after* the snapshot has been derived yet *before* the
 * snapshot is logged in the running xacts WAL record. We resolve this by
 * starting to accumulate changes at a point just prior to when we derive
 * the snapshot on the primary, then ignore duplicates when we later apply
 * the snapshot from the running xacts record. This is implemented during
 * CreateCheckPoint() where we use the logical checkpoint location as
 * our starting point and then write the running xacts record immediately
 * before writing the main checkpoint WAL record. Since we always start
 * up from a checkpoint and are immediately at our starting point, we
 * unconditionally move to STANDBY_INITIALIZED. After this point we
 * must do 4 things:
 *	* move shared nextXid forwards as we see new xids
 *	* extend the clog and subtrans with each new xid
 *	* keep track of uncommitted known assigned xids
 *	* keep track of uncommitted AccessExclusiveLocks
 *
 * When we see a commit/abort we must remove known assigned xids and locks
 * from the completing transaction. Attempted removals that cannot locate
 * an entry are expected and must not cause an error when we are in state
 * STANDBY_INITIALIZED. This is implemented in StandbyReleaseLocks() and
 * KnownAssignedXidsRemove().
 *
 * Later, when we apply the running xact data we must be careful to ignore
 * transactions already committed, since those commits raced ahead when
 * making WAL entries.
 *
 * The loose timing also means that locks may be recorded that have a
 * zero xid, since xids are removed from procs before locks are removed.
 * So we must prune the lock list down to ensure we hold locks only for
 * currently running xids, performed by StandbyReleaseOldLocks().
 * Zero xids should no longer be possible, but we may be replaying WAL
 * from a time when they were possible.
 *
 * For logical decoding only the running xacts information is needed;
 * there's no need to look at the locking information, but it's logged anyway,
 * as there's no independent knob to just enable logical decoding. For
 * details of how this is used, check snapbuild.c's introductory comment.
