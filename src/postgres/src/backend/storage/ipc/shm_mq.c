/*
 * This structure represents the actual queue, stored in shared memory.
 *
 * Some notes on synchronization:
 *
 * mq_receiver and mq_bytes_read can only be changed by the receiver; and
 * mq_sender and mq_bytes_written can only be changed by the sender.
 * mq_receiver and mq_sender are protected by mq_mutex, although, importantly,
 * they cannot change once set, and thus may be read without a lock once this
 * is known to be the case.
 *
 * mq_bytes_read and mq_bytes_written are not protected by the mutex.  Instead,
 * they are written atomically using 8 byte loads and stores.  Memory barriers
 * must be carefully used to synchronize reads and writes of these values with
 * reads and writes of the actual data in mq_ring.
 *
 * mq_detached needs no locking.  It can be set by either the sender or the
 * receiver, but only ever from false to true, so redundant writes don't
 * matter.  It is important that if we set mq_detached and then set the
 * counterparty's latch, the counterparty must be certain to see the change
 * after waking up.  Since SetLatch begins with a memory barrier and ResetLatch
 * ends with one, this should be OK.
 *
 * mq_ring_size and mq_ring_offset never change after initialization, and
 * can therefore be read without the lock.
 *
 * Importantly, mq_ring can be safely read and written without a lock.
 * At any given time, the difference between mq_bytes_read and
 * mq_bytes_written defines the number of bytes within mq_ring that contain
 * unread data, and mq_bytes_read defines the position where those bytes
 * begin.  The sender can increase the number of unread bytes at any time,
 * but only the receiver can give license to overwrite those bytes, by
 * incrementing mq_bytes_read.  Therefore, it's safe for the receiver to read
 * the unread bytes it knows to be present without the lock.  Conversely,
 * the sender can write to the unused portion of the ring buffer without
 * the lock, because nobody else can be reading or writing those bytes.  The
 * receiver could be making more bytes unused by incrementing mq_bytes_read,
 * but that's OK.  Note that it would be unsafe for the receiver to read any
 * data it's already marked as read, or to write any data; and it would be
 * unsafe for the sender to reread any data after incrementing
 * mq_bytes_written, but fortunately there's no need for any of that.

/*
 * This structure is a backend-private handle for access to a queue.
 *
 * mqh_queue is a pointer to the queue we've attached, and mqh_segment is
 * an optional pointer to the dynamic shared memory segment that contains it.
 * (If mqh_segment is provided, we register an on_dsm_detach callback to
 * make sure we detach from the queue before detaching from DSM.)
 *
 * If this queue is intended to connect the current process with a background
 * worker that started it, the user can pass a pointer to the worker handle
 * to shm_mq_attach(), and we'll store it in mqh_handle.  The point of this
 * is to allow us to begin sending to or receiving from that queue before the
 * process we'll be communicating with has even been started.  If it fails
 * to start, the handle will allow us to notice that and fail cleanly, rather
 * than waiting forever; see shm_mq_wait_internal.  This is mostly useful in
 * simple cases - e.g. where there are just 2 processes communicating; in
 * more complex scenarios, every process may not have a BackgroundWorkerHandle
 * available, or may need to watch for the failure of more than one other
 * process at a time.
 *
 * When a message exists as a contiguous chunk of bytes in the queue - that is,
 * it is smaller than the size of the ring buffer and does not wrap around
 * the end - we return the message to the caller as a pointer into the buffer.
 * For messages that are larger or happen to wrap, we reassemble the message
 * locally by copying the chunks into a backend-local buffer.  mqh_buffer is
 * the buffer, and mqh_buflen is the number of bytes allocated for it.
 *
 * mqh_send_pending, is number of bytes that is written to the queue but not
 * yet updated in the shared memory.  We will not update it until the written
 * data is 1/4th of the ring size or the tuple queue is full.  This will
 * prevent frequent CPU cache misses, and it will also avoid frequent
 * SetLatch() calls, which are quite expensive.
 *
 * mqh_partial_bytes, mqh_expected_bytes, and mqh_length_word_complete
 * are used to track the state of non-blocking operations.  When the caller
 * attempts a non-blocking operation that returns SHM_MQ_WOULD_BLOCK, they
 * are expected to retry the call at a later time with the same argument;
 * we need to retain enough state to pick up where we left off.
 * mqh_length_word_complete tracks whether we are done sending or receiving
 * (whichever we're doing) the entire length word.  mqh_partial_bytes tracks
 * the number of bytes read or written for either the length word or the
 * message itself, and mqh_expected_bytes - which is used only for reads -
 * tracks the expected total size of the payload.
 *
 * mqh_counterparty_attached tracks whether we know the counterparty to have
 * attached to the queue at some previous point.  This lets us avoid some
 * mutex acquisitions.
 *
 * mqh_context is the memory context in effect at the time we attached to
 * the shm_mq.  The shm_mq_handle itself is allocated in this context, and
 * we make sure any other allocations we do happen in this context as well,
 * to avoid nasty surprises.
