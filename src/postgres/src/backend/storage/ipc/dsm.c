 * dsm.c
 *	  manage dynamic shared memory segments
 *
 * This file provides a set of services to make programming with dynamic
 * shared memory segments more convenient.  Unlike the low-level
 * facilities provided by dsm_impl.h and dsm_impl.c, mappings and segments
 * created using this module will be cleaned up automatically.  Mappings
 * will be removed when the resource owner under which they were created
 * is cleaned up, unless dsm_pin_mapping() is used, in which case they
 * have session lifespan.  Segments will be removed when there are no
 * remaining mappings, or at postmaster shutdown in any case.  After a
 * hard postmaster crash, remaining segments will be removed, if they
 * still exist, at the next postmaster startup.
