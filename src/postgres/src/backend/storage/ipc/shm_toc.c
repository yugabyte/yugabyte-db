 * is assumed to be a well-known or discoverable integer.  Other processes
 * accessing the shared memory segment can pass the same key to
 * shm_toc_lookup() to discover the addresses of those data structures.
 *
 * Since the shared memory segment may be mapped at different addresses within
 * different backends, we store relative rather than absolute pointers.
 *
 * This won't scale well to a large number of keys.  Hopefully, that isn't
 * necessary; if it proves to be, we might need to provide a more sophisticated
 * data structure here.  But the real idea here is just to give someone mapping
 * a dynamic shared memory the ability to find the bare minimum number of
 * pointers that they need to bootstrap.  If you're storing a lot of stuff in
