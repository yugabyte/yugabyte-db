 *
 * From Wikipedia[1]: "In parallel computing, a barrier is a type of
 * synchronization method.  A barrier for a group of threads or processes in
 * the source code means any thread/process must stop at this point and cannot
 * proceed until all other threads/processes reach this barrier."
 *
 * This implementation of barriers allows for static sets of participants
 * known up front, or dynamic sets of participants which processes can join or
 * leave at any time.  In the dynamic case, a phase number can be used to
 * track progress through a parallel algorithm, and may be necessary to
 * synchronize with the current phase of a multi-phase algorithm when a new
 * participant joins.  In the static case, the phase number is used
 * internally, but it isn't strictly necessary for client code to access it
 * because the phase can only advance when the declared number of participants
 * reaches the barrier, so client code should be in no doubt about the current
 * phase of computation at all times.
 *
 * Consider a parallel algorithm that involves separate phases of computation
 * A, B and C where the output of each phase is needed before the next phase
 * can begin.
 *
 * In the case of a static barrier initialized with 4 participants, each
 * participant works on phase A, then calls BarrierArriveAndWait to wait until
 * all 4 participants have reached that point.  When BarrierArriveAndWait
 * returns control, each participant can work on B, and so on.  Because the
 * barrier knows how many participants to expect, the phases of computation
 * don't need labels or numbers, since each process's program counter implies
 * the current phase.  Even if some of the processes are slow to start up and
 * begin running phase A, the other participants are expecting them and will
 * patiently wait at the barrier.  The code could be written as follows:
 *
 *     perform_a();
 *     BarrierArriveAndWait(&barrier, ...);
 *     perform_b();
 *     BarrierArriveAndWait(&barrier, ...);
 *     perform_c();
 *     BarrierArriveAndWait(&barrier, ...);
 *
 * If the number of participants is not known up front, then a dynamic barrier
 * is needed and the number should be set to zero at initialization.  New
 * complications arise because the number necessarily changes over time as
 * participants attach and detach, and therefore phases B, C or even the end
 * of processing may be reached before any given participant has started
 * running and attached.  Therefore the client code must perform an initial
 * test of the phase number after attaching, because it needs to find out
 * which phase of the algorithm has been reached by any participants that are
 * already attached in order to synchronize with that work.  Once the program
 * counter or some other representation of current progress is synchronized
 * with the barrier's phase, normal control flow can be used just as in the
 * static case.  Our example could be written using a switch statement with
 * cases that fall-through, as follows:
 *
 *     phase = BarrierAttach(&barrier);
 *     switch (phase)
 *     {
 *     case PHASE_A:
 *         perform_a();
 *         BarrierArriveAndWait(&barrier, ...);
 *     case PHASE_B:
 *         perform_b();
 *         BarrierArriveAndWait(&barrier, ...);
 *     case PHASE_C:
 *         perform_c();
 *         BarrierArriveAndWait(&barrier, ...);
 *     }
 *     BarrierDetach(&barrier);
 *
 * Static barriers behave similarly to POSIX's pthread_barrier_t.  Dynamic
 * barriers behave similarly to Java's java.util.concurrent.Phaser.
