 *
 * It turns out to be necessary to allow zeroed pages here too.  Even though

 * zeroed page in the file, and it will stay that way after restart.)  So we
 * allow zeroed pages here, and are careful that the page access macros
 * treat such a page as empty and without free space.  Eventually, VACUUM
