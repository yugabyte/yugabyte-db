 *	fsm_get_avail() let you get/set the value of a slot, and
 *	fsm_search_avail() lets you search for a slot with value >= X.

	 * node to the right, then climb up to the parent.  Stop when we reach
	 * a node with enough free space (as we must, since the root has enough
	 * space).
	 *
	 * The idea is to gradually expand our "search triangle", that is, all
	 * nodes covered by the current node, and to be sure we search to the
	 * right from the start point.  At the first step, only the target slot
	 * is examined.  When we move up from a left child to its parent, we are
	 * adding the right-hand subtree of that parent to the search triangle.
	 * When we move right then up from a right child, we are dropping the
	 * current search triangle (which we know doesn't contain any suitable
	 * page) and instead looking at the next-larger-size triangle to its
	 * right.  So we never look left from our original start point, and at
	 * each step the size of the search triangle doubles, ensuring it takes
	 * only log2(N) work to search N pages.
	 *
	 * The "move right" operation will wrap around if it hits the right edge
	 * of the tree, so the behavior is still good if we start near the right.
	 * Note also that the move-and-climb behavior ensures that we can't end
	 * up on one of the missing nodes at the right of the leaf level.
	 *
	 * For example, consider this tree:
	 *
	 *		   7
	 *	   7	   6
	 *	 5	 7	 6	 5
	 *	4 5 5 7 2 6 5 2
	 *				T
	 *
	 * Assume that the target node is the node indicated by the letter T,
	 * and we're searching for a node with value of 6 or higher. The search
	 * begins at T. At the first iteration, we move to the right, then to the
	 * parent, arriving at the rightmost 5. At the second iteration, we move
	 * to the right, wrapping around, then climb up, arriving at the 7 on the
	 * third level.  7 satisfies our search, so we descend down to the bottom,
	 * following the path of sevens.  This is in fact the first suitable page
	 * to the right of (allowing for wraparound) our start point.
