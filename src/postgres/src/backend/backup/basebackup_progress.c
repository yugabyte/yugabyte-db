/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * basebackup_progress.c
 *	  Basebackup sink implementing progress tracking, including but not
 *	  limited to command progress reporting.
 *
 * This should be used even if the PROGRESS option to the replication
 * command BASE_BACKUP is not specified. Without that option, we won't
 * have tallied up the size of the files that are going to need to be
 * backed up, but we can still report to the command progress reporting
 * facility how much data we've processed.
 *
 * Moreover, we also use this as a convenient place to update certain
 * fields of the bbsink_state. That work is accurately described as
 * keeping track of our progress, but it's not just for introspection.
 * We need those fields to be updated properly in order for base backups
 * to work.
 *
 * This particular basebackup sink requires extra callbacks that most base
 * backup sinks don't. Rather than cramming those into the interface, we just
 * have a few extra functions here that basebackup.c can call. (We could put
 * the logic directly into that file as it's fairly simple, but it seems
 * cleaner to have everything related to progress reporting in one place.)
