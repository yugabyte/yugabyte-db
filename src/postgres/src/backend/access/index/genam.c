 *		general access method routines
 *
 *		All indexed access methods use an identical scan structure.
 *		We don't know how the various AMs do locking, however, so we don't
 *		do anything about that here.
 *
 *		The intent is that an AM implementor will define a beginscan routine
 *		that calls RelationGetIndexScan, to fill in the scan, and then does
 *		whatever kind of locking he wants.
 *
 *		At the end of a scan, the AM's endscan routine undoes the locking,
 *		but does *not* call IndexScanEnd --- the higher-level index_endscan
 *		routine does that.  (We can't do it in the AM because index_endscan
 *		still needs to touch the IndexScanDesc after calling the AM.)
 *
 *		Because of this, the AM does not have a choice whether to call
 *		RelationGetIndexScan or not; its beginscan routine must return an
 *		object made by RelationGetIndexScan.  This is kinda ugly but not
 *		worth cleaning up now.
