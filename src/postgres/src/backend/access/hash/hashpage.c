 *
 * NOTES
 *	  Postgres hash pages look like ordinary relation pages.  The opaque
 *	  data at high addresses includes information about the page including
 *	  whether a page is an overflow page or a true bucket, the bucket
 *	  number, and the block numbers of the preceding and following pages
 *	  in the same bucket.
 *
 *	  The first page in a hash relation, page zero, is special -- it stores
 *	  information describing the hash table; it is referred to as the
 *	  "meta page." Pages one and higher store the actual data.
 *
 *	  There are also bitmap pages, which are not manipulated here;
 *	  see hashovfl.c.

 * bucket.
 *
 * We are splitting a bucket that consists of a base bucket page and zero
 * or more overflow (bucket chain) pages.  We must relocate tuples that
 * belong in the new bucket.
 *
 * The caller must hold cleanup locks on both buckets to ensure that
 * no one else is trying to access them (see README).
 *
 * The caller must hold a pin, but no lock, on the metapage buffer.
 * The buffer is returned in the same state.  (The metapage is only
 * touched if it becomes necessary to add or remove overflow pages.)
 *
 * Split needs to retain pin on primary bucket pages of both old and new
 * buckets till end of operation.  This is to prevent vacuum from starting
 * while a split is in progress.
 *
 * In addition, the caller must have created the new bucket's base page,
 * which is passed in buffer nbuf, pinned and write-locked.  The lock will be
 * released here and pin must be released by the caller.  (The API is set up
 * this way because we must do _hash_getnewbuf() before releasing the metapage
 * write lock.  So instead of passing the new bucket's start block number, we
