 *
 * nbtsort.c
 *		Build a btree from sorted input by loading leaf pages sequentially.
 *
 * NOTES
 *
 * We use tuplesort.c to sort the given index tuples into order.
 * Then we scan the index tuples in order and build the btree pages
 * for each level.  We load source tuples into leaf-level pages.
 * Whenever we fill a page at one level, we add a link to it to its
 * parent level (starting a new parent level if necessary).  When
 * done, we write out each final page on each level, adding it to
 * its parent level.  When we have only one page on a level, it must be
 * the root -- it can be attached to the btree metapage and we are done.
 *
 * It is not wise to pack the pages entirely full, since then *any*
 * insertion would cause a split (and not only of the leaf page; the need
 * for a split would cascade right up the tree).  The steady-state load
 * factor for btrees is usually estimated at 70%.  We choose to pack leaf
 * pages to the user-controllable fill factor (default 90%) while upper pages
 * are always packed to 70%.  This gives us reasonable density (there aren't
 * many upper pages if the keys are reasonable-size) without risking a lot of
 * cascading splits during early insertions.
 *
 * Formerly the index pages being built were kept in shared buffers, but
 * that is of no value (since other backends have no interest in them yet)
 * and it created locking problems for CHECKPOINT, because the upper-level
 * pages were held exclusive-locked for long periods.  Now we just build
 * the pages in local memory and smgrwrite or smgrextend them as we finish
 * them.  They will need to be re-read into shared buffers on first use after
 * the build finishes.
 *
 * This code isn't concerned about the FSM at all. The caller is responsible
 * for initializing that.

 * Add an item to a disk page from the sort output (or add a posting list
 * item formed from the sort output).
 *
 * We must be careful to observe the page layout conventions of nbtsearch.c:
 * - rightmost pages start data items at P_HIKEY instead of at P_FIRSTKEY.
 * - on non-leaf pages, the key portion of the first item need not be
 *	 stored, we should store only the link.
 *
 * A leaf page being built looks like:
 *
 * +----------------+---------------------------------+
 * | PageHeaderData | linp0 linp1 linp2 ...           |
 * +-----------+----+---------------------------------+
 * | ... linpN |									  |
 * +-----------+--------------------------------------+
 * |	 ^ last										  |
 * |												  |
 * +-------------+------------------------------------+
 * |			 | itemN ...                          |
 * +-------------+------------------+-----------------+
 * |		  ... item3 item2 item1 | "special space" |
 * +--------------------------------+-----------------+
 *
 * Contrast this with the diagram in bufpage.h; note the mismatch
 * between linps and items.  This is because we reserve linp0 as a
 * placeholder for the pointer to the "high key" item; when we have
 * filled up the page, we will set linp0 to point to itemN and clear
 * linpN.  On the other hand, if we find this is the last (rightmost)
 * page, we leave the items alone and slide the linp array over.  If
 * the high key is to be truncated, offset 1 is deleted, and we insert
 * the truncated high key at offset 1.
 *
 * 'last' pointer indicates the last offset added to the page.
 *
 * 'truncextra' is the size of the posting list in itup, if any.  This
 * information is stashed for the next call here, when we may benefit
 * from considering the impact of truncating away the posting list on
 * the page before deciding to finish the page off.  Posting lists are
 * often relatively large, so it is worth going to the trouble of
 * accounting for the saving from truncating away the posting list of
 * the tuple that becomes the high key (that may be the only way to
 * get close to target free space on the page).  Note that this is
 * only used for the soft fillfactor-wise limit, not the critical hard
 * limit.
