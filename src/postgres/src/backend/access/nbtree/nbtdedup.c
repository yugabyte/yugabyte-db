/*
 * Perform a deduplication pass.
 *
 * The general approach taken here is to perform as much deduplication as
 * possible to free as much space as possible.  Note, however, that "single
 * value" strategy is used for !bottomupdedup callers when the page is full of
 * tuples of a single value.  Deduplication passes that apply the strategy
 * will leave behind a few untouched tuples at the end of the page, preparing
 * the page for an anticipated page split that uses nbtsplitloc.c's own single
 * value strategy.  Our high level goal is to delay merging the untouched
 * tuples until after the page splits.
 *
 * When a call to _bt_bottomupdel_pass() just took place (and failed), our
 * high level goal is to prevent a page split entirely by buying more time.
 * We still hope that a page split can be avoided altogether.  That's why
 * single value strategy is not even considered for bottomupdedup callers.
 *
 * The page will have to be split if we cannot successfully free at least
 * newitemsz (we also need space for newitem's line pointer, which isn't
 * included in caller's newitemsz).
 *
 * Note: Caller should have already deleted all existing items with their
 * LP_DEAD bits set.

 * interval is known, and interval gets finalized (i.e. when caller sees next
 * tuple on the page is not a duplicate, or when caller runs out of tuples to
 * process from leaf page).
 *
 * This is where bottom-up deletion determines and remembers which entries are
 * duplicates.  This will be important information to the tableam delete
 * infrastructure later on.  Plain index tuple duplicates are marked
 * "promising" here, per tableam contract.
 *
 * Our approach to marking entries whose TIDs come from posting lists is more
 * complicated.  Posting lists can only be formed by a deduplication pass (or
 * during an index build), so recent version churn affecting the pointed-to
 * logical rows is not particularly likely.  We may still give a weak signal
 * about posting list tuples' entries (by marking just one of its TIDs/entries
 * promising), though this is only a possibility in the event of further
 * duplicate index tuples in final interval that covers posting list tuple (as
 * in the plain tuple case).  A weak signal/hint will be useful to the tableam
 * when it has no stronger signal to go with for the deletion operation as a
 * whole.
 *
 * The heuristics we use work well in practice because we only need to give
 * the tableam the right _general_ idea about where to look.  Garbage tends to
 * naturally get concentrated in relatively few table blocks with workloads
 * that bottom-up deletion targets.  The tableam cannot possibly rank all
 * available table blocks sensibly based on the hints we provide, but that's
 * okay -- only the extremes matter.  The tableam just needs to be able to
 * predict which few table blocks will have the most tuples that are safe to
 * delete for each deletion operation, with low variance across related

 * split point as further duplicates are inserted, and successive rightmost
 * page splits occur among pages that store the same duplicate value.  When
 * the page finally splits, it should end up BTREE_SINGLEVAL_FILLFACTOR% full,
 * just like it would if deduplication were disabled.
 *
 * We expect that affected workloads will require _several_ single value
 * strategy deduplication passes (over a page that only stores duplicates)
 * before the page is finally split.  The first deduplication pass should only
 * find regular non-pivot tuples.  Later deduplication passes will find
 * existing maxpostingsize-capped posting list tuples, which must be skipped
 * over.  The penultimate pass is generally the first pass that actually
 * reaches _bt_singleval_fillfactor(), and so will deliberately leave behind a
 * few untouched non-pivot tuples.  The final deduplication pass won't free
 * any space -- it will skip over everything without merging anything (it
 * retraces the steps of the penultimate pass).
 *
 * Fortunately, having several passes isn't too expensive.  Each pass (after
 * the first pass) won't spend many cycles on the large posting list tuples
 * left by previous passes.  Each pass will find a large contiguous group of
 * smaller duplicate tuples to merge together at the end of the page.
