/*
 *	_bt_findsplitloc() -- find an appropriate place to split a page.
 *
 * The main goal here is to equalize the free space that will be on each
 * split page, *after accounting for the inserted tuple*.  (If we fail to
 * account for it, we might find ourselves with too little room on the page
 * that it needs to go into!)
 *
 * If the page is the rightmost page on its level, we instead try to arrange
 * to leave the left split page fillfactor% full.  In this way, when we are
 * inserting successively increasing keys (consider sequences, timestamps,
 * etc) we will end up with a tree whose pages are about fillfactor% full,
 * instead of the 50% full result that we'd get without this special case.
 * This is the same as nbtsort.c produces for a newly-created tree.  Note
 * that leaf and nonleaf pages use different fillfactors.  Note also that
 * there are a number of further special cases where fillfactor is not
 * applied in the standard way.
 *
 * We are passed the intended insert position of the new tuple, expressed as
 * the offsetnumber of the tuple it must go in front of (this could be
 * maxoff+1 if the tuple is to go at the end).  The new tuple itself is also
 * passed, since it's needed to give some weight to how effective suffix
 * truncation will be.  The implementation picks the split point that
 * maximizes the effectiveness of suffix truncation from a small list of
 * alternative candidate split points that leave each side of the split with
 * about the same share of free space.  Suffix truncation is secondary to
 * equalizing free space, except in cases with large numbers of duplicates.
 * Note that it is always assumed that caller goes on to perform truncation,
 * even with pg_upgrade'd indexes where that isn't actually the case
 * (!heapkeyspace indexes).  See nbtree/README for more information about
 * suffix truncation.
 *
 * We return the index of the first existing tuple that should go on the
 * righthand page (which is called firstrightoff), plus a boolean
 * indicating whether the new tuple goes on the left or right page.  You
 * can think of the returned state as a point _between_ two adjacent data
 * items (laftleft and firstright data items) on an imaginary version of
 * origpage that already includes newitem.  The bool is necessary to
 * disambiguate the case where firstrightoff == newitemoff (i.e. it is
 * sometimes needed to determine if the firstright tuple for the split is
 * newitem rather than the tuple from origpage at offset firstrightoff).
