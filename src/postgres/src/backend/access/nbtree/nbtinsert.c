	 * It might be necessary to check a page to the right in _bt_check_unique,

	 * would-be inserter can be making the check at one time.  Furthermore,
	 * once we are past the check we hold write locks continuously until we
	 * have performed our insertion, so no later inserter can fail to see our
	 * insertion.  (This requires some care in _bt_findinsertloc.)
	 *

 * Search the tree for a particular scankey, or more precisely for the first
 * leaf page it could be on.  Try to make use of the fastpath optimization's
 * rightmost leaf page cache before actually searching the tree from the root
 * page, though.
 *
 * Return value is a stack of parent-page pointers (though see notes about
 * fastpath optimization and page splits below).  insertstate->buf is set to
 * the address of the leaf-page buffer, which is write-locked and pinned in
 * all cases (if necessary by creating a new empty root page for caller).
 *
 * The fastpath optimization avoids most of the work of searching the tree
 * repeatedly when a single backend inserts successive new tuples on the
 * rightmost leaf page of an index.  A backend cache of the rightmost leaf
 * page is maintained within _bt_insertonpg(), and used here.  The cache is
 * invalidated here when an insert of a non-pivot tuple must take place on a
 * non-rightmost leaf page.
 *
 * The optimization helps with indexes on an auto-incremented field.  It also
 * helps with indexes on datetime columns, as well as indexes with lots of
 * NULL values.  (NULLs usually get inserted in the rightmost page for single
 * column indexes, since they usually get treated as coming after everything
 * else in the key space.  Individual NULL tuples will generally be placed on
 * the rightmost leaf page due to the influence of the heap TID column.)
 *
 * Note that we avoid applying the optimization when there is insufficient
 * space on the rightmost page to fit caller's new item.  This is necessary
 * because we'll need to return a real descent stack when a page split is
 * expected (actually, caller can cope with a leaf page split that uses a NULL
 * stack, but that's very slow and so must be avoided).  Note also that the
 * fastpath optimization acquires the lock on the page conditionally as a way
 * of reducing extra contention when there are concurrent insertions into the
 * rightmost page (we give up if we'd have to wait for the lock).  We assume
 * that it isn't useful to apply the optimization when there is contention,
 * since each per-backend cache won't stay valid for long.

 *		get the hint.
 *
 *		On exit, insertstate buffer contains the chosen insertion page, and
 *		the offset within that page is returned.  If _bt_findinsertloc needed
 *		to move right, the lock and pin on the original page are released, and

 *
 *		If insertstate contains cached binary search bounds, we will take

 * _bt_simpledel_pass - Simple index tuple deletion pass.
 *
 * We delete all LP_DEAD-set index tuples on a leaf page.  The offset numbers
 * of all such tuples are determined by caller (caller passes these to us as
 * its 'deletable' argument).
 *
 * We might also delete extra index tuples that turn out to be safe to delete
 * in passing (though they must be cheap to check in passing to begin with).
 * There is no certainty that any extra tuples will be deleted, though.  The
 * high level goal of the approach we take is to get the most out of each call
 * here (without noticeably increasing the per-call overhead compared to what
 * we need to do just to be able to delete the page's LP_DEAD-marked index
 * tuples).
 *
 * The number of extra index tuples that turn out to be deletable might
 * greatly exceed the number of LP_DEAD-marked index tuples due to various
 * locality related effects.  For example, it's possible that the total number
 * of table blocks (pointed to by all TIDs on the leaf page) is naturally
 * quite low, in which case we might end up checking if it's possible to
 * delete _most_ index tuples on the page (without the tableam needing to
 * access additional table blocks).  The tableam will sometimes stumble upon
 * _many_ extra deletable index tuples in indexes where this pattern is
 * common.
 *
 * See nbtree/README for further details on simple index tuple deletion.
