 * Returns how many blocks should be considered favorable/contiguous for a

 * There is always at least one favorable block during bottom-up index
 * deletion.  In the worst case (i.e. with totally random heap blocks) the
 * first block in line (the only favorable block) can be thought of as a
 * degenerate array of contiguous blocks that consists of a single block.
 * heap_index_delete_tuples() will expect this.
 *
 * Caller passes blockgroups, a description of the final order that deltids
 * will be sorted in for heap_index_delete_tuples() bottom-up index deletion
 * processing.  Note that deltids need not actually be sorted just yet (caller
 * only passes deltids to us so that we can interpret blockgroups).
 *
 * You might guess that the existence of contiguous blocks cannot matter much,
 * since in general the main factor that determines which blocks we visit is
 * the number of promising TIDs, which is a fixed hint from the index AM.
 * We're not really targeting the general case, though -- the actual goal is
 * to adapt our behavior to a wide variety of naturally occurring conditions.
 * The effects of most of the heuristics we apply are only noticeable in the
 * aggregate, over time and across many _related_ bottom-up index deletion
 * passes.
 *
 * Deeming certain blocks favorable allows heapam to recognize and adapt to
 * workloads where heap blocks visited during bottom-up index deletion can be
 * accessed contiguously, in the sense that each newly visited block is the
 * neighbor of the block that bottom-up deletion just finished processing (or
 * close enough to it).  It will likely be cheaper to access more favorable
 * blocks sooner rather than later (e.g. in this pass, not across a series of
 * related bottom-up passes).  Either way it is probably only a matter of time
 * (or a matter of further correlated version churn) before all blocks that
 * appear together as a single large batch of favorable blocks get accessed by
 * _some_ bottom-up pass.  Large batches of favorable blocks tend to either
 * appear almost constantly or not even once (it all depends on per-index
 * workload characteristics).
 *
 * Note that the blockgroups sort order applies a power-of-two bucketing
 * scheme that creates opportunities for contiguous groups of blocks to get
 * batched together, at least with workloads that are naturally amenable to
 * being driven by heap block locality.  This doesn't just enhance the spatial
 * locality of bottom-up heap block processing in the obvious way.  It also
 * enables temporal locality of access, since sorting by heap block number
 * naturally tends to make the bottom-up processing order deterministic.
 *
 * Consider the following example to get a sense of how temporal locality
 * might matter: There is a heap relation with several indexes, each of which
 * is low to medium cardinality.  It is subject to constant non-HOT updates.
 * The updates are skewed (in one part of the primary key, perhaps).  None of
 * the indexes are logically modified by the UPDATE statements (if they were
 * then bottom-up index deletion would not be triggered in the first place).
 * Naturally, each new round of index tuples (for each heap tuple that gets a
 * heap_update() call) will have the same heap TID in each and every index.
 * Since these indexes are low cardinality and never get logically modified,
 * heapam processing during bottom-up deletion passes will access heap blocks
 * in approximately sequential order.  Temporal locality of access occurs due
 * to bottom-up deletion passes behaving very similarly across each of the
 * indexes at any given moment.  This keeps the number of buffer misses needed
 * to visit heap blocks to a minimum.

	 * promising tuples for each block group up to the next power-of-two,
	 * unless it is very low (less than 4), in which case we round up to 4.
	 * npromisingtids is far too noisy to trust when choosing between a pair
	 * of block groups that both have very low values.
	 *
	 * This scheme divides heap blocks/block groups into buckets.  Each bucket
	 * contains blocks that have _approximately_ the same number of promising
	 * TIDs as each other.  The goal is to ignore relatively small differences
	 * in the total number of promising entries, so that the whole process can
	 * give a little weight to heapam factors (like heap block locality)
	 * instead.  This isn't a trade-off, really -- we have nothing to lose. It
	 * would be foolish to interpret small differences in npromisingtids
	 * values as anything more than noise.
	 *
	 * We tiebreak on nhtids when sorting block group subsets that have the
	 * same npromisingtids, but this has the same issues as npromisingtids,
	 * and so nhtids is subject to the same power-of-two bucketing scheme. The
	 * only reason that we don't fix nhtids in the same way here too is that
	 * we'll need accurate nhtids values after the sort.  We handle nhtids
	 * bucketization dynamically instead (in the sort comparator).
