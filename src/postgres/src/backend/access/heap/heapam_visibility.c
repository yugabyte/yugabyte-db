 *
 * heapam_visibility.c
 *	  Tuple visibility rules for tuples stored in heap.
 *
 * NOTE: all the HeapTupleSatisfies routines will update the tuple's
 * "hint" status bits if we see that the inserting or deleting transaction
 * has now committed or aborted (and it is safe to set the hint bits).
 * If the hint bits are changed, MarkBufferDirtyHint is called on
 * the passed-in buffer.  The caller must hold not only a pin, but at least
 * shared buffer content lock on the buffer containing the tuple.
 *
 * NOTE: When using a non-MVCC snapshot, we must check
 * TransactionIdIsInProgress (which looks in the PGPROC array)
 * before TransactionIdDidCommit/TransactionIdDidAbort (which look in
 * pg_xact).  Otherwise we have a race condition: we might decide that a
 * just-committed transaction crashed, because none of the tests succeed.
 * xact.c is careful to record commit/abort in pg_xact before it unsets
 * MyProc->xid in the PGPROC array.  That fixes that problem, but it
 * also means there is a window where TransactionIdIsInProgress and
 * TransactionIdDidCommit will both return true.  If we check only
 * TransactionIdDidCommit, we could consider a tuple committed when a
 * later GetSnapshotData call will still think the originating transaction
 * is in progress, which leads to application-level inconsistency.  The
 * upshot is that we gotta check TransactionIdIsInProgress first in all
 * code paths, except for a few cases where we are looking at
 * subtransactions of our own main transaction and so there can't be any
 * race condition.
 *
 * When using an MVCC snapshot, we rely on XidInMVCCSnapshot rather than
 * TransactionIdIsInProgress, but the logic is otherwise the same: do not
 * check pg_xact until after deciding that the xact is no longer in progress.
 *
 *
 * Summary of visibility functions:
 *
 *	 HeapTupleSatisfiesMVCC()
 *		  visible to supplied snapshot, excludes current command
 *	 HeapTupleSatisfiesUpdate()
 *		  visible to instant snapshot, with user-supplied command
 *		  counter and more complex result
 *	 HeapTupleSatisfiesSelf()
 *		  visible to instant snapshot and current command
 *	 HeapTupleSatisfiesDirty()
 *		  like HeapTupleSatisfiesSelf(), but includes open transactions
 *	 HeapTupleSatisfiesVacuum()
 *		  visible to any running transaction, used by VACUUM
 *	 HeapTupleSatisfiesNonVacuumable()
 *		  Snapshot-style API for HeapTupleSatisfiesVacuum
 *	 HeapTupleSatisfiesToast()
 *		  visible unless part of interrupted vacuum, used for TOAST
 *	 HeapTupleSatisfiesAny()
 *		  all tuples are visible

/*
 * SetHintBits()
 *
 * Set commit/abort hint bits on a tuple, if appropriate at this time.
 *
 * It is only safe to set a transaction-committed hint bit if we know the
 * transaction's commit record is guaranteed to be flushed to disk before the
 * buffer, or if the table is temporary or unlogged and will be obliterated by
 * a crash anyway.  We cannot change the LSN of the page here, because we may
 * hold only a share lock on the buffer, so we can only use the LSN to
 * interlock this if the buffer's LSN already is newer than the commit LSN;
 * otherwise we have to just refrain from setting the hint bit until some
 * future re-examination of the tuple.
 *
 * We can always set hint bits when marking a transaction aborted.  (Some
 * code in heapam.c relies on that!)
 *
 * Also, if we are cleaning up HEAP_MOVED_IN or HEAP_MOVED_OFF entries, then
 * we can always set the hint bits, since pre-9.0 VACUUM FULL always used
 * synchronous commits and didn't move tuples that weren't previously
 * hinted.  (This is not known by this subroutine, but is applied by its
 * callers.)  Note: old-style VACUUM FULL is gone, but we have to keep this
 * module's support for MOVED_OFF/MOVED_IN flag bits for as long as we
 * support in-place update from pre-9.0 databases.
 *
 * Normal commits may be asynchronous, so for those we need to get the LSN
 * of the transaction and then check whether this is flushed.
 *
 * The caller should pass xid as the XID of the transaction to check, or
 * InvalidTransactionId if no check is needed.
