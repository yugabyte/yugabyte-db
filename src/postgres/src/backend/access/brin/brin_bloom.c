 *
 *
 * A BRIN opclass summarizing page range into a bloom filter.
 *
 * Bloom filters allow efficient testing whether a given page range contains
 * a particular value. Therefore, if we summarize each page range into a small
 * bloom filter, we can easily (and cheaply) test whether it contains values
 * we get later.
 *
 * The index only supports equality operators, similarly to hash indexes.
 * Bloom indexes are however much smaller, and support only bitmap scans.
 *
 * Note: Don't confuse this with bloom indexes, implemented in a contrib
 * module. That extension implements an entirely new AM, building a bloom
 * filter on multiple columns in a single row. This opclass works with an
 * existing AM (BRIN) and builds bloom filter on a column.
 *
 *
 * values vs. hashes
 * -----------------
 *
 * The original column values are not used directly, but are first hashed
 * using the regular type-specific hash function, producing a uint32 hash.
 * And this hash value is then added to the summary - i.e. it's hashed
 * again and added to the bloom filter.
 *
 * This allows the code to treat all data types (byval/byref/...) the same
 * way, with only minimal space requirements, because we're working with
 * hashes and not the original values. Everything is uint32.
 *
 * Of course, this assumes the built-in hash function is reasonably good,
 * without too many collisions etc. But that does seem to be the case, at
 * least based on past experience. After all, the same hash functions are
 * used for hash indexes, hash partitioning and so on.
 *
 *
 * hashing scheme
 * --------------
 *
 * Bloom filters require a number of independent hash functions. There are
 * different schemes how to construct them - for example we might use
 * hash_uint32_extended with random seeds, but that seems fairly expensive.
 * We use a scheme requiring only two functions described in this paper:
 *
 * Less Hashing, Same Performance:Building a Better Bloom Filter
 * Adam Kirsch, Michael Mitzenmacher, Harvard School of Engineering and
 * Applied Sciences, Cambridge, Massachusetts [DOI 10.1002/rsa.20208]
 *
 * The two hash functions h1 and h2 are calculated using hard-coded seeds,
 * and then combined using (h1 + i * h2) to generate the hash functions.
 *
 *
 * sizing the bloom filter
 * -----------------------
 *
 * Size of a bloom filter depends on the number of distinct values we will
 * store in it, and the desired false positive rate. The higher the number
 * of distinct values and/or the lower the false positive rate, the larger
 * the bloom filter. On the other hand, we want to keep the index as small
 * as possible - that's one of the basic advantages of BRIN indexes.
 *
 * Although the number of distinct elements (in a page range) depends on
 * the data, we can consider it fixed. This simplifies the trade-off to
 * just false positive rate vs. size.
 *
 * At the page range level, false positive rate is a probability the bloom
 * filter matches a random value. For the whole index (with sufficiently
 * many page ranges) it represents the fraction of the index ranges (and
 * thus fraction of the table to be scanned) matching the random value.
 *
 * Furthermore, the size of the bloom filter is subject to implementation
 * limits - it has to fit onto a single index page (8kB by default). As
 * the bitmap is inherently random (when "full" about half the bits is set
 * to 1, randomly), compression can't help very much.
 *
 * To reduce the size of a filter (to fit to a page), we have to either
 * accept higher false positive rate (undesirable), or reduce the number
 * of distinct items to be stored in the filter. We can't alter the input
 * data, of course, but we may make the BRIN page ranges smaller - instead
 * of the default 128 pages (1MB) we may build index with 16-page ranges,
 * or something like that. This should reduce the number of distinct values
 * in the page range, making the filter smaller (with fixed false positive
 * rate). Even for random data sets this should help, as the number of rows
 * per heap page is limited (to ~290 with very narrow tables, likely ~20
 * in practice).
 *
 * Of course, good sizing decisions depend on having the necessary data,
 * i.e. number of distinct values in a page range (of a given size) and
 * table size (to estimate cost change due to change in false positive
 * rate due to having larger index vs. scanning larger indexes). We may
 * not have that data - for example when building an index on empty table
 * it's not really possible. And for some data we only have estimates for
 * the whole table and we can only estimate per-range values (ndistinct).
 *
 * Another challenge is that while the bloom filter is per-column, it's
 * the whole index tuple that has to fit into a page. And for multi-column
 * indexes that may include pieces we have no control over (not necessarily
 * bloom filters, the other columns may use other BRIN opclasses). So it's
 * not entirely clear how to distribute the space between those columns.
 *
 * The current logic, implemented in brin_bloom_get_ndistinct, attempts to
 * make some basic sizing decisions, based on the size of BRIN ranges, and
 * the maximum number of rows per range.
