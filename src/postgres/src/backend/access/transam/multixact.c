 *
 * multixact.c
 *		PostgreSQL multi-transaction-log manager
 *
 * The pg_multixact manager is a pg_xact-like manager that stores an array of
 * MultiXactMember for each MultiXactId.  It is a fundamental part of the
 * shared-row-lock implementation.  Each MultiXactMember is comprised of a
 * TransactionId and a set of flag bits.  The name is a bit historical:
 * originally, a MultiXactId consisted of more than one TransactionId (except
 * in rare corner cases), hence "multi".  Nowadays, however, it's perfectly
 * legitimate to have MultiXactIds that only include a single Xid.
 *
 * The meaning of the flag bits is opaque to this module, but they are mostly
 * used in heapam.c to identify lock modes that each of the member transactions
 * is holding on any given tuple.  This module just contains support to store
 * and retrieve the arrays.
 *
 * We use two SLRU areas, one for storing the offsets at which the data
 * starts for each MultiXactId in the other one.  This trick allows us to
 * store variable length arrays of TransactionIds.  (We could alternatively
 * use one area containing counts and TransactionIds, with valid MultiXactId
 * values pointing at slots containing counts; but that way seems less robust
 * since it would get completely confused if someone inquired about a bogus
 * MultiXactId that pointed to an intermediate slot containing an XID.)
 *
 * XLOG interactions: this module generates a record whenever a new OFFSETs or
 * MEMBERs page is initialized to zeroes, as well as an
 * XLOG_MULTIXACT_CREATE_ID record whenever a new MultiXactId is defined.
 * This module ignores the WAL rule "write xlog before data," because it
 * suffices that actions recording a MultiXactId in a heap xmax do follow that
 * rule.  The only way for the MXID to be referenced from any data page is for
 * heap_lock_tuple() or heap_update() to have put it there, and each generates
 * an XLOG record that must follow ours.  The normal LSN interlock between the
 * data page and that XLOG record will ensure that our XLOG record reaches
 * disk first.  If the SLRU members/offsets data reaches disk sooner than the
 * XLOG records, we do not care; after recovery, no xmax will refer to it.  On
 * the flip side, to ensure that all referenced entries _do_ reach disk, this
 * module's XLOG records completely rebuild the data entered since the last
 * checkpoint.  We flush and sync all dirty OFFSETs and MEMBERs pages to disk
 * before each checkpoint is considered complete.
 *
 * Like clog.c, and unlike subtrans.c, we have to preserve state across
 * crashes and ensure that MXID and offset numbering increases monotonically
 * across a crash.  We do this in the same way as it's done for transaction
 * IDs: the WAL record is guaranteed to contain evidence of every MXID we
 * could need to worry about, and we just make sure that at the end of
 * replay, the next-MXID and next-offset counters are at least as large as
 * anything we saw during replay.
 *
 * We are able to remove segments no longer necessary by carefully tracking
 * each table's used values: during vacuum, any multixact older than a certain
 * value is removed; the cutoff value is stored in pg_class.  The minimum value
 * across all tables in each database is stored in pg_database, and the global
 * minimum across all databases is part of pg_control and is kept in shared
 * memory.  Whenever that minimum is advanced, the SLRUs are truncated.
 *
 * When new multixactid values are to be created, care is taken that the
 * counter does not fall within the wraparound horizon considering the global
 * minimum value.

	 * that multis that have member xids that are older than the cutoff point
	 * for xids must also be frozen, even if the multis themselves are newer

	 *
	 * 2. The next multixact may still be in process of being filled in: that
	 * is, another process may have done GetNewMultiXactId but not yet written
	 * the offset entry for that ID.  In that scenario, it is guaranteed that
	 * the offset entry for that multixact exists (because GetNewMultiXactId
	 * won't release MultiXactGenLock until it does) but contains zero
	 * (because we are careful to pre-zero offset pages). Because
	 * GetNewMultiXactId will never return zero as the starting offset for a
	 * multixact, when we read zero as the next multixact's offset, we know we
	 * have this case.  We sleep for a bit and try again.
	 *
	 * 3. Because GetNewMultiXactId increments offset zero to offset one to
	 * handle case #2, there is an ambiguity near the point of offset
	 * wraparound.  If we see next multixact's offset is one, is that our
	 * multixact's actual endpoint, or did it end at zero with a subsequent
	 * increment?  We handle this using the knowledge that if the zero'th
	 * member slot wasn't filled, it'll contain zero, and zero isn't a valid
	 * transaction ID so it can't be a multixact member.  Therefore, if we
	 * read a zero from the members array, just ignore it.
	 *
	 * This is all pretty messy, but the mess occurs only in infrequent corner
	 * cases, so it seems better than holding the MultiXactGenLock for a long
	 * time on every multixact creation.
