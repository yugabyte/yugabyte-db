 * commit_ts.c
 *		PostgreSQL commit timestamp manager
 *
 * This module is a pg_xact-like system that stores the commit timestamp
 * for each transaction.
 *
 * XLOG interactions: this module generates an XLOG record whenever a new
 * CommitTs page is initialized to zeroes.  Also, one XLOG record is
 * generated for setting of values when the caller requests it; this allows
 * us to support values coming from places other than transaction commit.
 * Other writes of CommitTS come from recording of transaction commit in
 * xact.c, which generates its own XLOG records for these events and will
 * re-perform the status update on redo; so we need make no additional XLOG
 * entry here.

/*
 * Decide whether a commitTS page number is "older" for truncation purposes.

 * At default BLCKSZ, (1 << 31) % COMMIT_TS_XACTS_PER_PAGE == 128.  This
 * introduces differences compared to CLOG and the other SLRUs having (1 <<
 * 31) % per_page == 0.  This function never tests exactly
 * TransactionIdPrecedes(x-2^31, x).  When the system reaches xidStopLimit,
 * there are two possible counts of page boundaries between oldestXact and the
 * latest XID assigned, depending on whether oldestXact is within the first
 * 128 entries of its page.  Since this function doesn't know the location of
 * oldestXact within page2, it returns false for one page that actually is
 * expendable.  This is a wider (yet still negligible) version of the
 * truncation opportunity that CLOGPagePrecedes() cannot recognize.
 *
 * For the sake of a worked example, number entries with decimal values such
 * that page1==1 entries range from 1.0 to 1.999.  Let N+0.15 be the number of
 * pages that 2^31 entries will span (N is an integer).  If oldestXact=N+2.1,
 * then the final safe XID assignment leaves newestXact=1.95.  We keep page 2,
 * because entry=2.85 is the border that toggles whether entries precede the
 * last entry of the oldestXact page.  While page 2 is expendable at
 * oldestXact=N+2.1, it would be precious at oldestXact=N+2.9.
