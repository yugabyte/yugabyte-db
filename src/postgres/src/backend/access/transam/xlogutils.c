 * XLogReadBufferForRedo
 *		Read a page during XLOG replay
 *
 * Reads a block referenced by a WAL record into shared buffer cache, and

 * record includes a full-page image of the page, it is restored.
 *
 * 'record.EndRecPtr' is compared to the page's LSN to determine if the record
 * has already been replayed.  'block_id' is the ID number the block was
 * registered with, when the WAL record was created.
 *
 * Returns one of the following:
 *
 *	BLK_NEEDS_REDO	- changes from the WAL record need to be applied
 *	BLK_DONE		- block doesn't need replaying
 *	BLK_RESTORED	- block was restored from a full-page image included in
 *					  the record
 *	BLK_NOTFOUND	- block was not found (because it was truncated away by
 *					  an operation later in the WAL stream)
 *
 * On return, the buffer is locked in exclusive-mode, and returned in *buf.
 * Note that the buffer is locked and returned even if it doesn't need
 * replaying.  (Getting the buffer lock is not really necessary during
 * single-process crash recovery, but some subroutines such as MarkBufferDirty
 * will complain if we don't have the lock.  In hot standby mode it's
 * definitely necessary.)
 *
 * Note: when a backup block is available in XLOG with the BKPIMAGE_APPLY flag
 * set, we restore it, even if the page in the database appears newer.  This
 * is to protect ourselves against database pages that were partially or
 * incorrectly written during a crash.  We assume that the XLOG data must be
 * good because it has passed a CRC check, while the database page might not
 * be.  This will force us to replay all subsequent modifications of the page
 * that appear in XLOG, rather than possibly ignoring them as already
 * applied, but that's not a huge drawback.

/*
 * XLogReadBufferExtended
 *		Read a page during XLOG replay
 *
 * This is functionally comparable to ReadBufferExtended. There's some
 * differences in the behavior wrt. the "mode" argument:
 *
 * In RBM_NORMAL mode, if the page doesn't exist, or contains all-zeroes, we
 * return InvalidBuffer. In this case the caller should silently skip the
 * update on this page. (In this situation, we expect that the page was later
 * dropped or truncated. If we don't see evidence of that later in the WAL
 * sequence, we'll complain at the end of WAL replay.)
 *
 * In RBM_ZERO_* modes, if the page doesn't exist, the relation is extended
 * with all-zeroes pages up to the given block number.
 *
 * In RBM_NORMAL_NO_LOG mode, we return InvalidBuffer if the page doesn't
 * exist, and we don't check for all-zeroes.  Thus, no log entry is made
 * to imply that the page should be dropped or truncated later.
 *
 * Optionally, recent_buffer can be used to provide a hint about the location
 * of the page in the buffer pool; it does not have to be correct, but avoids
 * a buffer mapping table probe if it is.
 *
 * NB: A redo function should normally not call this directly. To get a page
 * to modify, use XLogReadBufferForRedoExtended instead. It is important that
 * all pages modified by a WAL record are registered in the WAL records, or
 * they will be invisible to tools that need to know which pages are modified.

 *
 * We switch to an xlog segment from the new timeline eagerly when on a
 * historical timeline, as soon as we reach the start of the xlog segment
 * containing the timeline switch.  The server copied the segment to the new
 * timeline so all the data up to the switch point is the same, but there's no
