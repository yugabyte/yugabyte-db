 * number of workers given by pcxt->nworkers_launched have initialized and
 * attached to their error queues.  Whether or not these workers are guaranteed
 * to still be running depends on what code the caller asked them to run;
 * this function does not guarantee that they have not exited.  However, it
 * does guarantee that any workers which exited must have done so cleanly and
 * after successfully performing the work with which they were tasked.
 *
 * If this function is not called, then some of the workers that were launched
 * may not have been started due to a fork() failure, or may have exited during
 * early startup prior to attaching to the error queue, so nworkers_launched
 * cannot be viewed as completely reliable.  It will never be less than the
 * number of workers which actually started, but it might be more.  Any workers
 * that failed to start will still be discovered by
 * WaitForParallelWorkersToFinish and an error will be thrown at that time,
 * provided that function is eventually reached.
 *
 * In general, the leader process should do as much work as possible before
 * calling this function.  fork() failures and other early-startup failures
 * are very uncommon, and having the leader sit idle when it could be doing
 * useful work is undesirable.  However, if the leader needs to wait for
 * all of its workers or for a specific worker, it may want to call this
 * function before doing so.  If not, it must make some other provision for
 * the failure-to-start case, lest it wait forever.  On the other hand, a
 * leader which never waits for a worker that might not be started yet, or
 * at least never does so prior to WaitForParallelWorkersToFinish(), need not
 * call this function at all.
