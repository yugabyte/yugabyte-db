 *
 * clog.c
 *		PostgreSQL transaction-commit-log manager
 *
 * This module replaces the old "pg_log" access code, which treated pg_log
 * essentially like a relation, in that it went through the regular buffer
 * manager.  The problem with that was that there wasn't any good way to
 * recycle storage space for transactions so old that they'll never be
 * looked up again.  Now we use specialized access code so that the commit
 * log can be broken into relatively small, independent segments.
 *
 * XLOG interactions: this module generates an XLOG record whenever a new
 * CLOG page is initialized to zeroes.  Other writes of CLOG come from
 * recording of transaction commit or abort in xact.c, which generates its
 * own XLOG records for these events and will re-perform the status update
 * on redo; so we need make no additional XLOG entry here.  For synchronous
 * transaction commits, the XLOG is guaranteed flushed through the XLOG commit
 * record before we are called to log a commit, so the WAL rule "write xlog
 * before data" is satisfied automatically.  However, for async commits we
 * must track the latest LSN affecting each CLOG page, so that we can flush
 * XLOG that far and satisfy the WAL rule.  We don't have to worry about this
 * for aborts (whether sync or async), since the post-crash assumption would
 * be that such transactions failed anyway.

 * TransactionIdSetTreeStatus
 *
 * Record the final state of transaction entries in the commit log for
 * a transaction and its subtransaction tree. Take care to ensure this is
 * efficient, and as atomic as possible.
 *
 * xid is a single xid to set status for. This will typically be
 * the top level transactionid for a top level commit or abort. It can
 * also be a subtransaction when we record transaction aborts.
 *
 * subxids is an array of xids of length nsubxids, representing subtransactions
 * in the tree of xid. In various cases nsubxids may be zero.
 *
 * lsn must be the WAL location of the commit record when recording an async
 * commit.  For a synchronous commit it can be InvalidXLogRecPtr, since the
 * caller guarantees the commit record is already flushed in that case.  It
 * should be InvalidXLogRecPtr for abort cases, too.
 *
 * In the commit case, atomicity is limited by whether all the subxids are in
 * the same CLOG page as xid.  If they all are, then the lock will be grabbed
 * only once, and the status will be set to committed directly.  Otherwise
 * we must
 *	 1. set sub-committed all subxids that are not on the same page as the
 *		main xid
 *	 2. atomically set committed the main xid and the subxids on the same page
 *	 3. go over the first bunch again and set them committed
 * Note that as far as concurrent checkers are concerned, main transaction
 * commit as a whole is still atomic.
 *
 * Example:
 *		TransactionId t commits and has subxids t1, t2, t3, t4
 *		t is on page p1, t1 is also on p1, t2 and t3 are on p2, t4 is on p3
 *		1. update pages2-3:
 *					page2: set t2,t3 as sub-committed
 *					page3: set t4 as sub-committed
 *		2. update page1:
 *					set t1 as sub-committed,
 *					then set t as committed,
					then set t1 as committed
 *		3. update pages2-3:
 *					page2: set t2,t3 as committed
 *					page3: set t4 as committed
 *
 * NB: this is a low-level routine and is NOT the preferred entry point
 * for most uses; functions in transam.c are the intended callers.
 *
 * XXX Think about issuing POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED on pages that we will need,
 * but aren't yet in cache, as well as hinting pages not to fall out of
 * cache yet.
