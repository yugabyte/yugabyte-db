 * xlogrecovery.c
 *		Functions for WAL recovery, standby mode
 *
 * This source file contains functions controlling WAL recovery.
 * InitWalRecovery() initializes the system for crash or archive recovery,
 * or standby mode, depending on configuration options and the state of
 * the control file and possible backup label file.  PerformWalRecovery()
 * performs the actual WAL replay, calling the rmgr-specific redo routines.
 * EndWalRecovery() performs end-of-recovery checks and cleanup actions,
 * and prepares information needed to initialize the WAL for writes.  In
 * addition to these three main functions, there are a bunch of functions
 * for interrogating recovery state and controlling the recovery process.
