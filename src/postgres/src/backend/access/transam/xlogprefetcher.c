 *
 * This module provides a drop-in replacement for an XLogReader that tries to
 * minimize I/O stalls by looking ahead in the WAL.  If blocks that will be
 * accessed in the near future are not already in the buffer pool, it initiates
 * I/Os that might complete before the caller eventually needs the data.  When
 * referenced blocks are found in the buffer pool already, the buffer is
 * recorded in the decoded record so that XLogReadBufferForRedo() can try to
 * avoid a second buffer mapping table lookup.
 *
 * Currently, only the main fork is considered for prefetching.  Currently,
 * prefetching is only effective on systems where BufferPrefetch() does
 * something useful (mainly Linux).
