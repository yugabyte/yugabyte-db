 * syncscan.c
 *	  scan synchronization support
 *
 * When multiple backends run a sequential scan on the same table, we try
 * to keep them synchronized to reduce the overall I/O needed.  The goal is
 * to read each page into shared buffer cache only once, and let all backends
 * that take part in the shared scan process the page before it falls out of
 * the cache.
 *
 * Since the "leader" in a pack of backends doing a seqscan will have to wait
 * for I/O, while the "followers" don't, there is a strong self-synchronizing
 * effect once we can get the backends examining approximately the same part
 * of the table at the same time.  Hence all that is really needed is to get
 * a new backend beginning a seqscan to begin it close to where other backends
 * are reading.  We can scan the table circularly, from block X up to the
 * end and then from block 0 to X-1, to ensure we visit all rows while still
 * participating in the common scan.
 *
 * To accomplish that, we keep track of the scan position of each table, and
 * start new scans close to where the previous scan(s) are.  We don't try to
 * do any extra synchronization to keep the scans together afterwards; some
 * scans might progress much more slowly than others, for example if the
 * results need to be transferred to the client over a slow network, and we
 * don't want such queries to slow down others.
 *
 * There can realistically only be a few large sequential scans on different
 * tables in progress at any time.  Therefore we just keep the scan positions
 * in a small LRU list which we scan every time we need to look up or update a
 * scan position.  The whole mechanism is only applied for tables exceeding
 * a threshold size (but that is not the concern of this module).
