/*-------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * gistbuild.c
 *	  build algorithm for GiST indexes implementation.
 *
 * There are two different strategies:
 *
 * 1. Sort all input tuples, pack them into GiST leaf pages in the sorted
 *    order, and create downlinks and internal pages as we go. This builds
 *    the index from the bottom up, similar to how B-tree index build
 *    works.
 *
 * 2. Start with an empty index, and insert all tuples one by one.
 *
 * The sorted method is used if the operator classes for all columns have
 * a 'sortsupport' defined. Otherwise, we resort to the second strategy.
 *
 * The second strategy can optionally use buffers at different levels of
 * the tree to reduce I/O, see "Buffering build algorithm" in the README
 * for a more detailed explanation. It initially calls insert over and
 * over, but switches to the buffered algorithm after a certain number of
 * tuples (unless buffering mode is disabled).

	 * cached in the shared buffer cache and the OS cache, so we choose
	 * levelStep so that the subtree size is comfortably smaller than
	 * effective_cache_size, with a safety factor of 4.
	 *
	 * The estimate on the average number of index tuples on page is based on
	 * average tuple sizes observed before switching to buffered build, so the
	 * real subtree size can be somewhat larger. Also, it would selfish to
	 * gobble the whole cache for our index build. The safety factor of 4
	 * should account for those effects.
	 *
	 * The other limiting factor for setting levelStep is that while
	 * processing a subtree, we need to hold one page for each buffer at the
	 * next lower buffered level. The max. number of buffers needed for that
	 * is maxIndexTuplesPerPage^levelStep. This is very conservative, but
	 * hopefully maintenance_work_mem is set high enough that you're
	 * constrained by effective_cache_size rather than maintenance_work_mem.

	 * buffer, but that is not currently taken into account. That scales on

 * Whenever a page is split, we need to insert the downlinks into the parent.
 * We need to somehow find the parent page to do that. In normal insertions,
 * we keep a stack of nodes visited when we descend the tree. However, in
 * buffering build, we can start descending the tree from any internal node,
 * when we empty a buffer by cascading tuples to its children. So we don't
 * have a full stack up to the root available at that time.
 *
 * So instead, we maintain a hash table to track the parent of every internal
 * page. We don't need to track the parents of leaf nodes, however. Whenever
 * we insert to a leaf, we've just descended down from its parent, so we know
 * its immediate parent already. This helps a lot to limit the memory used
 * by this hash table.
 *
 * Whenever an internal node is split, the parent map needs to be updated.
 * the parent of the new child page needs to be recorded, and also the
 * entries for all page whose downlinks are moved to a new page at the split
 * needs to be updated.
 *
 * We also update the parent map whenever we descend the tree. That might seem
 * unnecessary, because we maintain the map whenever a downlink is moved or
 * created, but it is needed because we switch to buffering mode after
 * creating a tree with regular index inserts. Any pages created before
 * switching to buffering mode will not be present in the parent map initially,
 * but will be added there the first time we visit them.
