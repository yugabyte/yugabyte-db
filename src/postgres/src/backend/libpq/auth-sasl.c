 * Perform a SASL exchange with a libpq client, using a specific mechanism

 * shadow_pass is an optional pointer to the stored secret of the role
 * authenticated, from pg_authid.rolpassword.  For mechanisms that use
 * shadowed passwords, a NULL pointer here means that an entry could not
 * be found for the role (or the user does not exist), and the mechanism
 * should fail the authentication exchange.
 *
 * Mechanisms must take care not to reveal to the client that a user entry
 * does not exist; ideally, the external failure mode is identical to that
 * of an incorrect password.  Mechanisms may instead use the logdetail
 * output parameter to internally differentiate between failure cases and
 * assist debugging by the server admin.
 *
 * A mechanism is not required to utilize a shadow entry, or even a password
 * system at all; for these cases, shadow_pass may be ignored and the caller
 * should just pass NULL.
