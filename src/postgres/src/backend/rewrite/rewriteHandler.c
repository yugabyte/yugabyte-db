/*
 * AcquireRewriteLocks -
 *	  Acquire suitable locks on all the relations mentioned in the Query.
 *	  These locks will ensure that the relation schemas don't change under us
 *	  while we are rewriting, planning, and executing the query.
 *
 * Caution: this may modify the querytree, therefore caller should usually
 * have done a copyObject() to make a writable copy of the querytree in the
 * current memory context.
 *
 * forExecute indicates that the query is about to be executed.  If so,
 * we'll acquire the lock modes specified in the RTE rellockmode fields.
 * If forExecute is false, AccessShareLock is acquired on all relations.
 * This case is suitable for ruleutils.c, for example, where we only need
 * schema stability and we don't intend to actually modify any relations.
 *
 * forUpdatePushedDown indicates that a pushed-down FOR [KEY] UPDATE/SHARE
 * applies to the current subquery, requiring all rels to be opened with at
 * least RowShareLock.  This should always be false at the top of the
 * recursion.  When it is true, we adjust RTE rellockmode fields to reflect
 * the higher lock level.  This flag is ignored if forExecute is false.
 *
 * A secondary purpose of this routine is to fix up JOIN RTE references to
 * dropped columns (see details below).  Such RTEs are modified in-place.
 *
 * This processing can, and for efficiency's sake should, be skipped when the
 * querytree has just been built by the parser: parse analysis already got
 * all the same locks we'd get here, and the parser will have omitted dropped
 * columns from JOINs to begin with.  But we must do this whenever we are
 * dealing with a querytree produced earlier than the current command.
 *
 * About JOINs and dropped columns: although the parser never includes an
 * already-dropped column in a JOIN RTE's alias var list, it is possible for
 * such a list in a stored rule to include references to dropped columns.
 * (If the column is not explicitly referenced anywhere else in the query,
 * the dependency mechanism won't consider it used by the rule and so won't
 * prevent the column drop.)  To support get_rte_attribute_is_dropped(), we
 * replace join alias vars that reference dropped columns with null pointers.
 *
 * (In PostgreSQL 8.0, we did not do this processing but instead had
 * get_rte_attribute_is_dropped() recurse to detect dropped columns in joins.
 * That approach had horrible performance unfortunately; in particular
 * construction of a nested join was O(N^2) in the nesting depth.)
