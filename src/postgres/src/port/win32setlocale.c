 *
 *
 * The setlocale() function in Windows is broken in two ways. First, it
 * has a problem with locale names that have a dot in the country name. For
 * example:
 *
 * "Chinese (Traditional)_Hong Kong S.A.R..950"
 *
 * For some reason, setlocale() doesn't accept that as argument, even though
 * setlocale(LC_ALL, NULL) returns exactly that. Fortunately, it accepts
 * various alternative names for such countries, so to work around the broken
 * setlocale() function, we map the troublemaking locale names to accepted
 * aliases, before calling setlocale().
 *
 * The second problem is that the locale name for "Norwegian (Bokm&aring;l)"
 * contains a non-ASCII character. That's problematic, because it's not clear
 * what encoding the locale name itself is supposed to be in, when you
 * haven't yet set a locale. Also, it causes problems when the cluster
 * contains databases with different encodings, as the locale name is stored
 * in the pg_database system catalog. To work around that, when setlocale()
 * returns that locale name, map it to a pure-ASCII alias for the same
 * locale.
