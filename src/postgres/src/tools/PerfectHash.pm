# PerfectHash.pm
#    Perl module that constructs minimal perfect hash functions
#
# This code constructs a minimal perfect hash function for the given
# set of keys, using an algorithm described in
# "An optimal algorithm for generating minimal perfect hash functions"
# by Czech, Havas and Majewski in Information Processing Letters,
# 43(5):256-264, October 1992.
# This implementation is loosely based on NetBSD's "nbperf",
# which was written by Joerg Sonnenberger.
#
# The resulting hash function is perfect in the sense that if the presented
# key is one of the original set, it will return the key's index in the set
# (in range 0..N-1).  However, the caller must still verify the match,
# as false positives are possible.  Also, the hash function may return
# values that are out of range (negative or >= N), due to summing unrelated
# hashtable entries.  This indicates that the presented key is definitely
# not in the set.

# At runtime, we'll compute two simple hash functions of the input key,
# and use them to index into a mapping table.  The hash functions are just
# multiply-and-add in uint32 arithmetic, with different multipliers and
# initial seeds.  All the complexity in this module is concerned with
# selecting hash parameters that will work and building the mapping table.

# We support making case-insensitive hash functions, though this only
# works for a strict-ASCII interpretation of case insensitivity,
# ie, A-Z maps onto a-z and nothing else.

# The keys should be passed as an array reference.  They can be any set
# of Perl strings; it is caller's responsibility that there not be any
# duplicates.  (Note that the "strings" can be binary data, but hashing
# e.g. OIDs has endianness hazards that callers must overcome.)
#
# The name to use for the function is specified as the second argument.
# It will be a global function by default, but the caller may prepend
# "static " to the result string if it wants a static function.
#
# Additional options can be specified as keyword-style arguments:
#
# case_fold => bool
# If specified as true, the hash function is case-insensitive, for the
# limited idea of case-insensitivity explained above.
#
# fixed_key_length => N
# If specified, all keys are assumed to have length N bytes, and the
# hash function signature will be just "int f(const void *key)"
# rather than "int f(const void *key, size_t keylen)".
