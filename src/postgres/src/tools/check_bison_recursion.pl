# check_bison_recursion.pl -- check for right recursion in Bison grammars
#
# The standard way to parse list constructs in Bison grammars is via left
# recursion, wherein a nonterminal symbol has itself as the first symbol
# in one of its expansion rules.  It is also possible to parse a list via
# right recursion, wherein a nonterminal symbol has itself as the last
# symbol of an expansion; but that's a bad way to write it because a long
# enough list will result in parser stack overflow.  Since Bison doesn't
# have any built-in way to warn about use of right recursion, we use this
# script when we want to check for the problem.
#
# To use: run bison with the -v switch, then feed the produced y.output
# file to this script.
