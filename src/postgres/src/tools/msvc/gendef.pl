		# We're not interested in the symbol index or offset.

		# SECT[ION] is only examined to see whether the symbol is defined in a
		# COFF section of the local object file; if UNDEF, it's a symbol to be
		# resolved at link time from another object so we can't export it.
		#
		# SYMTYPE is always notype for C symbols as there's no typeinfo and no
		# way to get the symbol type from name (de)mangling. However, we care
		# if "notype" is suffixed by "()" or not. The presence of () means the
		# symbol is a function, the absence means it isn't.
		#
		# SYMSTATIC indicates whether it's a compilation-unit local "static"
		# symbol ("Static"), or whether it's available for use from other
		# compilation units ("External"). We export all symbols that aren't
		# static as part of the whole program DLL interface to produce UNIX-like
		# default linkage.
		#
		# SYMNAME is, obviously, the symbol name. The leading underscore
		# indicates that the _cdecl calling convention is used. See
		# http://www.unixwiz.net/techtips/win32-callconv.html
		# http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1388/Calling-Conventions-Demystified
