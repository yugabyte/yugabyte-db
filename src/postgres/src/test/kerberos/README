Tests for Kerberos/GSSAPI functionality
=======================================

This directory contains a test suite for Kerberos/GSSAPI
functionality.  This requires a full MIT Kerberos installation,
including server and client tools, and is therefore kept separate and
not run by default.

CAUTION: The test server run by this test is configured to listen for TCP
connections on localhost. Any user on the same host is able to log in to the
test server while the tests are running. Do not run this suite on a multi-user
system where you don't trust all local users! Also, this test suite creates a
KDC server that listens for TCP/IP connections on localhost without any real
access control.

Running the tests
=================

NOTE: You must have given the --enable-tap-tests argument to configure.

Run
    make check
or
    make installcheck
You can use "make installcheck" if you previously did "make install".
In that case, the code in the installation tree is tested.  With
"make check", a temporary installation tree is built from the current
sources and then tested.

Either way, this test initializes, starts, and stops a test Postgres
cluster, as well as a test KDC server.

See src/test/perl/README for more info about running these tests.

Requirements
============

MIT Kerberos server and client tools are required.  Heimdal is not
supported.

Debian/Ubuntu packages: krb5-admin-server krb5-kdc krb5-user

RHEL/CentOS/Fedora packages: krb5-server krb5-workstation

FreeBSD port: krb5 (base system has Heimdal)
