-- KEY Pushdown Processing.
-- This file tests key-pushdown for system table scan.
--
-- Different from UserTable, system tables and its indexes are centralized in one tablet. To take
-- advantage of this fact, systable-scan queries the data using an INDEX key in one operation.
-- Normally it'd take two operations, one to select ROWID and another to select actual data.
--
-- Test forward scan.
