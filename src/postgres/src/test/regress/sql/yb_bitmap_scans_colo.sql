-- Hints can tell the planner to use a Bitmap Scan, but they cannot tell the
-- planner how to design the plan. The planner chooses for itself how it should
-- apply remote filters, Bitmap Ands, Bitmap Ors. For these queries, we are
-- interested in testing the behaviour of a BitmapAnd, not testing the planner's
-- ability to choose between a bitmap scan and a sequential scan. IF the planner
-- must choose a bitmap scan, what plan does it choose? Does that plan work?
