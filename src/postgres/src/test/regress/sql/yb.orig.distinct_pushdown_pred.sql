-- These tests illustrate some similarities and differences uniqkeys have with sortkeys.
--
-- Many of the differences arise from the fact that DISTINCT eliminates rows while
-- ORDER BY does not do that by itself. This fact has an important consequence that
-- sorting commutes with filters while uniq does not necessarily do that.
--
-- Differences
-- ===========
-- 1) uniqkeys are still useful even if only a subset of the index prefix is queried.
--    However, ORDER BY requires the complete prefix of the index to be requested
--    a partial sort is not useful for further sorting.
--    On the other hand, a partial DISTINCT helps eliminate irrelevant rows early on.
-- 2) Equivalence keys have limited utility with uniqkeys.
--    The most obvious example is when r1 = r2. Do not exclude r2 from the distinct prefix
--    since distinct values of r1 may not retrieve correct values of r2 from LSM.
--    This is because the scan module picks the first DISTINCT r1 row and not
--    the ones where r1 = r2.
--    While this behavior may change in the future to account for non-index predicates,
--    it still cannot rule out local predicates on the postgres side.
--    On the other hand, ORDER BY r1, r2 can be reduced to ORDER BY r1 irrespective
--    of additional predicates when r1 = r2.
--    All that said, r1 = r2 AND r2 = 1 is equivalent to r1 = 1 AND r2 = 1.
-- 3) Another major difference is in the handling of constants. Constants can be completely
--    eliminated in ORDER BY. For example, r2 = 1 ORDER BY r1, r2 is equivalent to ORDER BY r1
--    since there at most one distinct value of r2, so no explicit sorting is necessary.
--    However, the table might have multiple tuples with r2 = 1 and distinct values of r1.
--    Hence, a unique node is still necessary even when r2 is excluded from the prefix.
-- 4) Moreover, it is neither necessary nor sufficient for r2 to be equivalent to constant.
--    Instead, the scan requires that r2 = 1 be an index clause since otherwise the corresponding
--    tuple may be missed by nature of the distinct index scan. One example is when an index scan occurs
--    as part of the inner relation of a nested loop join operation.
--    More generally, a distinct index scan can be used even with Merge and Hash Joins
--    when the inner relation tuples must be unique.
-- 5) As another example, a DISTINCT on a non key column cannot be eliminated despite being
--    equal to a constant, e.g. v = 1, since currently only index clauses seep past
--    the DISTINCT operation.
-- 6) Distinct Index Scan may also be generated in the presence of simple non-volatile targets
--    and clauses. This is unlike sort where volatile clauses do not affect sort order.
--    However, the scan must generate distinct values of all target and clause references
--    (bar several exceptions).
-- 7) Adding onto comment (2), when r1 = r2, while DocDB cannot use a prefix of length 1,
--    postgres itself can treat r1 and r2 as equivalent. So query DISTINCT r1 is the same as
--    DISTINCT r2.

-- Do not eliminate r2, see comment (2) above.
-- However, since r1 is equivalent to r2, the query still requests a distinct prefix regardless, see comment (7).

-- Implementing DISTINCT support for hash columns requires that
--
-- 1) Distinct Prefix spans all hash columns. While DocDB stores hash columns
--    in sorted order in the index, DocDB also prepends a hash_code that is a
--    hash of all the hash columns. This structure makes it so that skipping
--    over duplicate prefix of hash columns is simply not possible.
--    For example, consider a scenario where the first column is degenerate
--    with all values being equal. The iterator cannot skip to the end since
--    the hash code changes with changing values of the second hash column.
-- 2) Hash ordering is leakproof. Despite all the differences mentioned
--    between sorting and uniq, these two operations are closely related.
--    DocDB is able to skip over duplicate elements precisely because the
--    columns are sorted by the prefix. Supporting hash columns for uniq
--    exposes the risk of considering hash columns for sorting. It does not
--    help that the hash columns are deceptively sorted. The hash_code column
--    at the start makes it so that the leading hash column is not sorted
--    similar to how a lower range column is not sorted. Except a query can
--    request an ordering of the index prefix but not the hash code.
-- 3) Unlike tables with a leading range column, tables with leading hash
--    columns are separated cleanly by virtue of hash code. Hence, no unique
--    node is necessary here on top unlike range column exclusive prefixes.

-- All hash columns.
-- Isn't necessary to stick a unique node on top since hash columns
-- separate cleanly across tables.
