# src/test/regress/yb_misc_serial_schedule
#
####################################################################################################
# This testsuite includes miscellaneous tests that are not yet characterized to a proper testsuite.
# This schedule and its siblings schedules (yb_misc_serialN_schedule) are designed to contain a
# reasonable number of tests in order to avoid test timeout for each of these schedules.
# Because some tests are larger and take longer time to run, the number of tests in each
# schedule can be quite different: one schedule can contain quite a few tests if each test
# is small, another schedule can contain only one test if the test is large.
# The tests in these schedules are not ported from PostgreSQL original tests.
