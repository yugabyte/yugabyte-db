Documentation concerning how to run these regression tests and interpret
the results can be found in the PostgreSQL manual, in the chapter
"Regression Tests".

YugabyteDB uses PgRegressRunner found in java/yb-pgsql/src/test/java/org/yb/pgsql
to run smaller schedules prefixed with yb_.  These schedules run tests prefixed
with yb_.  The tests named yb_pg_foo are ported from upstream postgres test
foo.  The tests named yb_foo are new tests created for YugabyteDB.  See also
the bottom of docs/content/latest/contribute/core-database/run-unit-tests.md
for this naming convention.

Ported tests (those named yb_pg_foo) should be ordered the same way as
parallel_schedule.  Otherwise, tests may not have the right dependencies or
expected state.
