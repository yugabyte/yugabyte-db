Documentation concerning how to run these regression tests and interpret
the results can be found in the PostgreSQL manual, in the chapter
"Regression Tests".

YugabyteDB uses PgRegressRunner found in
java/yb-pgsql/src/test/java/org/yb/pgsql to run smaller schedules prefixed with
yb_.  These schedules run tests prefixed with "yb.".  The tests named
yb.port.foo are ported from upstream postgres test foo.  The tests named
yb.orig.foo are new tests created for YugabyteDB.  See also the bottom of
docs/content/preview/contribute/core-database/build-and-test.md for this naming
convention.

Ported tests (those named yb.port.foo) should be ordered the same way as
parallel_schedule.  Otherwise, tests may not have the right dependencies or
expected state.

yb.depd.foo are targeted dependency tests that set up certain objects and
eliminate the need to run whole dependency tests such as yb.port.test_setup and
yb.port.create_index.

The yb_commands directory holds sql scripts to be \i included in tests.
