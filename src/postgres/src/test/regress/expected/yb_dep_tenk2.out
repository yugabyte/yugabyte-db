-- A collection of queries to build the tenk2 table.
--
-- The queries are taken from the relevant dependency files.  Since it is
-- faster to run this rather than each file itself (e.g. dependency chain
-- test_setup, create_index), prefer using this.
--
-- DEPENDENCY: this file must be run after tenk1 has been populated (by
-- yb_dep_tenk1).

-- test_setup
