-- A collection of queries to build the tenk2 table.
--
-- The queries are taken from the relevant dependency files.  Since it is
-- faster to run this rather than each file itself (e.g. dependency chain
-- test_setup, create_index), prefer using this.  Also, to make it usable with
-- yb_pg_test_setup and yb_pg_create_index, make it idempotent.
--
-- DEPENDENCY: this file must be run after tenk1 has been populated.
--
-- To avoid IF NOT EXISTS NOTICE messages.
