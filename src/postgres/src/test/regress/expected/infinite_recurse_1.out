-- Unfortunately, up till mid 2020 the Linux kernel had a bug in PPC64
-- signal handling that would cause this test to crash if it happened
-- to receive an sinval catchup interrupt while the stack is deep:

-- It is likely to be many years before that bug disappears from all
-- production kernels, so disable this test on such platforms.

-- difference in the end state of the regression database.)
