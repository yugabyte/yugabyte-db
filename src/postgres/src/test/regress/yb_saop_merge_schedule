# src/test/regress/yb_saop_merge_schedule
#
# Test pggate merge sorting of IN queries that are not part of the sort order.
#
# The main structure of the tests in this schedule is to compare running a
# query with SAOP merge on and off.  The explain plan should have "Merge ..."
# fields under index scan nodes to indicate that.  Keep in mind that some
# negative tests expect SAOP merge to NOT be used: those should only explain
# analyze and not run the queries because there's no point in running the
# queries.
#
# SELECT targets generally follow a pattern of this order:
# 1. Columns equal to constant
# 1. Columns part of sorting, where non-key column "n" is always the last sort
#    column (except for cases where it is absolutely not needed such as
#    DISTINCT and GROUP BY) in order to provide consistently ordered results
# 1. Columns part of SAOP
# 1. Optionally, other columns

# Setup is used by tests in later lines.
