# Tests for inheritance trees with temporary relations
#
# Inheritance trees are allowed to mix relations with different persistence
# as long as a persistent child relation does not try to inherit from a
# temporary parent.  This checks several scenarios with SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE,
# DELETE and TRUNCATE.  Any temporary relation inheriting from the same
# persistent parent should be isolated and handled only in its own session.
