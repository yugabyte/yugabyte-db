# INSERT ... ON CONFLICT test verifying that speculative insertion
# failures are handled
#
# Does this by using advisory locks controlling progress of
# insertions. By waiting when building the index keys, it's possible
# to schedule concurrent INSERT ON CONFLICTs so that there will always
# be a speculative conflict.
