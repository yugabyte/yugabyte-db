# Tests for the EvalPlanQual mechanism
#
# EvalPlanQual is used in READ COMMITTED isolation level to attempt to
# re-execute UPDATE and DELETE operations against rows that were updated
# by some concurrent transaction.

# TODO: Currently ALTER TABLE on YB results in test failure because an online schema change
# marks the other sessions's txns as expired. To fix it, we will have to make changes to
# isolationtester.c and start other sessions only after setup is done. The following lines were
# removed from setup of tests related to ALTER TABLE:
#
# CREATE TABLE accounts_ext (accountid text PRIMARY KEY, balance numeric not null, other text);
# INSERT INTO accounts_ext VALUES ('checking', 600, 'other'), ('savings', 700, null);
# ALTER TABLE accounts_ext ADD COLUMN newcol int DEFAULT 42;
# ALTER TABLE accounts_ext ADD COLUMN newcol2 text DEFAULT NULL;

# TODO: YSQL doesn't support table inheritance yet. Below is the setup of tests with table
# inheritance:
# CREATE TABLE p (a int, b int, c int);
# CREATE TABLE c1 () INHERITS (p);
# CREATE TABLE c2 () INHERITS (p);
# CREATE TABLE c3 () INHERITS (p);
# INSERT INTO c1 SELECT 0, a / 3, a % 3 FROM generate_series(0, 9) a;
# INSERT INTO c2 SELECT 1, a / 3, a % 3 FROM generate_series(0, 9) a;
# INSERT INTO c3 SELECT 2, a / 3, a % 3 FROM generate_series(0, 9) a;
