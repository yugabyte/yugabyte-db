PostgreSQL tests
================

This directory contains a variety of test infrastructure as well as some of the
tests in PostgreSQL. Not all tests are here -- in particular, there are more in
individual contrib/ modules and in src/bin.

Not all these tests get run by "make check". Check src/test/Makefile to see
which tests get run automatically.
