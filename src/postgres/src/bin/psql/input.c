/*
 * Macros to iterate over each element of the history list in order
 *
 * You would think this would be simple enough, but in its inimitable fashion
 * libedit has managed to break it: in libreadline we must use next_history()
 * to go from oldest to newest, but in libedit we must use previous_history().
 * To detect what to do, we make a trial call of previous_history(): if it
 * fails, then either next_history() is what to use, or there's zero or one
 * history entry so that it doesn't matter which direction we go.
 *
 * In case that wasn't disgusting enough: the code below is not as obvious as
 * it might appear.  In some libedit releases history_set_pos(0) fails until
 * at least one add_history() call has been done.  This is not an issue for
 * printHistory() or encode_history(), which cannot be invoked before that has
 * happened.  In decode_history(), that's not so, and what actually happens is
 * that we are sitting on the newest entry to start with, previous_history()
 * fails, and we iterate over all the entries using next_history().  So the
 * decode_history() loop iterates over the entries in the wrong order when
 * using such a libedit release, and if there were another attempt to use
 * BEGIN_ITERATE_HISTORY() before some add_history() call had happened, it
 * wouldn't work.  Fortunately we don't care about either of those things.
 *
 * Usage pattern is:

 *			loop body referencing varname->line;
