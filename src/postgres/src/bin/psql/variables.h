/*
 * Variables can be given "assign hook" functions.  The assign hook can
 * prevent invalid values from being assigned, and can update internal C
 * variables to keep them in sync with the variable's current value.
 *
 * An assign hook function is called before any attempted assignment, with the
 * proposed new value of the variable (or with NULL, if an \unset is being
 * attempted).  If it returns false, the assignment doesn't occur --- it
 * should print an error message with pg_log_error() to tell the user why.
 *
 * When an assign hook function is installed with SetVariableHooks(), it is
 * called with the variable's current value (or with NULL, if it wasn't set
 * yet).  But its return value is ignored in this case.  The hook should be
 * set before any possibly-invalid value can be assigned.

/*
 * Variables can also be given "substitute hook" functions.  The substitute
 * hook can replace values (including NULL) with other values, allowing
 * normalization of variable contents.  For example, for a boolean variable,
 * we wish to interpret "\unset FOO" as "\set FOO off", and we can do that
 * by installing a substitute hook.  (We can use the same substitute hook
 * for all bool or nearly-bool variables, which is why this responsibility
 * isn't part of the assign hook.)
 *
 * The substitute hook is called before any attempted assignment, and before
 * the assign hook if any, passing the proposed new value of the variable as a
 * malloc'd string (or NULL, if an \unset is being attempted).  It can return
 * the same value, or a different malloc'd string, or modify the string
 * in-place.  It should free the passed-in value if it's not returning it.
 * The substitute hook generally should not complain about erroneous values;
 * that's a job for the assign hook.
 *
 * When a substitute hook is installed with SetVariableHooks(), it is applied
 * to the variable's current value (typically NULL, if it wasn't set yet).
 * That also happens before applying the assign hook.
