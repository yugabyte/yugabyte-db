/*
 * Parallel operation works like this:
 *
 * The original, leader process calls ParallelBackupStart(), which forks off
 * the desired number of worker processes, which each enter WaitForCommands().
 *
 * The leader process dispatches an individual work item to one of the worker
 * processes in DispatchJobForTocEntry().  We send a command string such as
 * "DUMP 1234" or "RESTORE 1234", where 1234 is the TocEntry ID.
 * The worker process receives and decodes the command and passes it to the
 * routine pointed to by AH->WorkerJobDumpPtr or AH->WorkerJobRestorePtr,
 * which are routines of the current archive format.  That routine performs
 * the required action (dump or restore) and returns an integer status code.
 * This is passed back to the leader where we pass it to the
 * ParallelCompletionPtr callback function that was passed to
 * DispatchJobForTocEntry().  The callback function does state updating
 * for the leader control logic in pg_backup_archiver.c.
 *
 * In principle additional archive-format-specific information might be needed
 * in commands or worker status responses, but so far that hasn't proved
 * necessary, since workers have full copies of the ArchiveHandle/TocEntry
 * data structures.  Remember that we have forked off the workers only after
 * we have read in the catalog.  That's why our worker processes can also
 * access the catalog information.  (In the Windows case, the workers are
 * threads in the same process.  To avoid problems, they work with cloned
 * copies of the Archive data structure; see RunWorker().)
 *
 * In the leader process, the workerStatus field for each worker has one of
 * the following values:
 *		WRKR_NOT_STARTED: we've not yet forked this worker
 *		WRKR_IDLE: it's waiting for a command
 *		WRKR_WORKING: it's working on a command
 *		WRKR_TERMINATED: process ended
 * The pstate->te[] entry for each worker is valid when it's in WRKR_WORKING
 * state, and must be NULL in other states.

/*
 * Code for responding to cancel interrupts (SIGINT, control-C, etc)
 *
 * This doesn't quite belong in this module, but it needs access to the
 * ParallelState data, so there's not really a better place either.
 *
 * When we get a cancel interrupt, we could just die, but in pg_restore that
 * could leave a SQL command (e.g., CREATE INDEX on a large table) running
 * for a long time.  Instead, we try to send a cancel request and then die.
 * pg_dump probably doesn't really need this, but we might as well use it
 * there too.  Note that sending the cancel directly from the signal handler
 * is safe because PQcancel() is written to make it so.
 *
 * In parallel operation on Unix, each process is responsible for canceling
 * its own connection (this must be so because nobody else has access to it).
 * Furthermore, the leader process should attempt to forward its signal to
 * each child.  In simple manual use of pg_dump/pg_restore, forwarding isn't
 * needed because typing control-C at the console would deliver SIGINT to
 * every member of the terminal process group --- but in other scenarios it
 * might be that only the leader gets signaled.
 *
 * On Windows, the cancel handler runs in a separate thread, because that's
 * how SetConsoleCtrlHandler works.  We make it stop worker threads, send
 * cancels on all active connections, and then return FALSE, which will allow
 * the process to die.  For safety's sake, we use a critical section to
 * protect the PGcancel structures against being changed while the signal
 * thread runs.
