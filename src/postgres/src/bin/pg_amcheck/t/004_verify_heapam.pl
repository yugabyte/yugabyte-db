# This regression test demonstrates that the pg_amcheck binary correctly
# identifies specific kinds of corruption within pages.  To test this, we need
# a mechanism to create corrupt pages with predictable, repeatable corruption.
# The postgres backend cannot be expected to help us with this, as its design
# is not consistent with the goal of intentionally corrupting pages.
#
# Instead, we create a table to corrupt, and with careful consideration of how
# postgresql lays out heap pages, we seek to offsets within the page and
# overwrite deliberately chosen bytes with specific values calculated to
# corrupt the page in expected ways.  We then verify that pg_amcheck reports
# the corruption, and that it runs without crashing.  Note that the backend
# cannot simply be started to run queries against the corrupt table, as the
# backend will crash, at least for some of the corruption types we generate.
#
# Autovacuum potentially touching the table in the background makes the exact
# behavior of this test harder to reason about.  We turn it off to keep things
# simpler.  We use a "belt and suspenders" approach, turning it off for the
# system generally in postgresql.conf, and turning it off specifically for the
# test table.
#
# This test depends on the table being written to the heap file exactly as we
# expect it to be, so we take care to arrange the columns of the table, and
# insert rows of the table, that give predictable sizes and locations within
# the table page.
#
# The HeapTupleHeaderData has 23 bytes of fixed size fields before the variable
# length t_bits[] array.  We have exactly 3 columns in the table, so natts = 3,
# t_bits is 1 byte long, and t_hoff = MAXALIGN(23 + 1) = 24.
#
# We're not too fussy about which datatypes we use for the test, but we do care
# about some specific properties.  We'd like to test both fixed size and
# varlena types.  We'd like some varlena data inline and some toasted.  And
# we'd like the layout of the table such that the datums land at predictable
# offsets within the tuple.  We choose a structure without padding on all
# supported architectures:
#
# 	a BIGINT
#	b TEXT
#	c TEXT
#
# We always insert a 7-ascii character string into field 'b', which with a
# 1-byte varlena header gives an 8 byte inline value.  We always insert a long
# text string in field 'c', long enough to force toast storage.
#
# We choose to read and write binary copies of our table's tuples, using perl's
# pack() and unpack() functions.  Perl uses a packing code system in which:
#
#	l = "signed 32-bit Long",
#	L = "Unsigned 32-bit Long",
#	S = "Unsigned 16-bit Short",
#	C = "Unsigned 8-bit Octet",
#
# Each tuple in our table has a layout as follows:
#
#    xx xx xx xx            t_xmin: xxxx		offset = 0		L
#    xx xx xx xx            t_xmax: xxxx		offset = 4		L
#    xx xx xx xx          t_field3: xxxx		offset = 8		L
#    xx xx                   bi_hi: xx			offset = 12		S
#    xx xx                   bi_lo: xx			offset = 14		S
#    xx xx                ip_posid: xx			offset = 16		S
#    xx xx             t_infomask2: xx			offset = 18		S
#    xx xx              t_infomask: xx			offset = 20		S
#    xx                     t_hoff: x			offset = 22		C
#    xx                     t_bits: x			offset = 23		C
#    xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx   'a': xxxxxxxx	offset = 24		LL
#    xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx   'b': xxxxxxxx	offset = 32		CCCCCCCC
#    xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx   'c': xxxxxxxx	offset = 40		CCllLL
#    xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx      : xxxxxxxx	 ...continued
#    xx xx                        : xx      	 ...continued
#
# We could choose to read and write columns 'b' and 'c' in other ways, but
# it is convenient enough to do it this way.  We define packing code
# constants here, where they can be compared easily against the layout.
