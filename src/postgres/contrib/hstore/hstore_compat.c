 * contrib/hstore/hstore_compat.c
 *
 * Notes on old/new hstore format disambiguation.
 *
 * There are three formats to consider:
 * 1) old contrib/hstore (referred to as hstore-old)
 * 2) prerelease pgfoundry hstore
 * 3) new contrib/hstore
 *
 * (2) and (3) are identical except for the HS_FLAG_NEWVERSION
 * bit, which is set in (3) but not (2).
 *
 * Values that are already in format (3), or which are
 * unambiguously in format (2), are handled by the first
 * "return immediately" test in hstoreUpgrade().
 *
 * To stress a point: we ONLY get here with possibly-ambiguous
 * values if we're doing some sort of in-place migration from an
 * old prerelease pgfoundry hstore-new; and we explicitly don't
 * support that without fixing up any potentially padded values
 * first. Most of the code here is serious overkill, but the
 * performance penalty isn't serious (especially compared to the
 * palloc() that we have to do anyway) and the belt-and-braces
 * validity checks provide some reassurance. (If for some reason
 * we get a value that would have worked on the old code, but
 * which would be botched by the conversion code, the validity
 * checks will fail it first so we get an error rather than bad
 * data.)
 *
 * Note also that empty hstores are the same in (2) and (3), so
 * there are some special-case paths for them.
 *
 * We tell the difference between formats (2) and (3) as follows (but
 * note that there are some edge cases where we can't tell; see
 * comments in hstoreUpgrade):
 *
 * First, since there must be at least one entry, we look at
 * how the bits line up. The new format looks like:
 *
 * 10kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk  (k..k = keylen)
 * 0nvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv  (v..v = keylen+vallen)
 *
 * The old format looks like one of these, depending on endianness
 * and bitfield layout: (k..k = keylen, v..v = vallen, p..p = pos,
 * n = isnull)
 *
 * kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
 * nppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
 *
 * kkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvv
 * pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppn
 *
 * vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
 * nppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp
 *
 * vvvvvvvvvvvvvvvvkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
 * pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppn   (usual i386 format)
 *
 * If the entry is in old format, for the first entry "pos" must be 0.
 * We can obviously see that either keylen or vallen must be >32768
 * for there to be any ambiguity (which is why lengths less than that
 * are fasttracked in hstore.h) Since "pos"==0, the "v" field in the
 * new-format interpretation can only be 0 or 1, which constrains all
 * but three bits of the old-format's k and v fields. But in addition
 * to all of this, the data length implied by the keylen and vallen
 * must fit in the varlena size. So the only ambiguous edge case for
 * hstores with only one entry occurs between a new-format entry with
 * an excess (~32k) of padding, and an old-format entry. But we know
 * which format to use in that case based on how we were compiled, so
 * no actual data corruption can occur.
 *
 * If there is more than one entry, the requirement that keys do not
 * decrease in length, and that positions increase contiguously, and
 * that the end of the data not be beyond the end of the varlena
 * itself, disambiguates in almost all other cases. There is a small
 * set of ambiguous cases which could occur if the old-format value
 * has a large excess of padding and just the right pattern of key
 * sizes, but these are also handled based on how we were compiled.
 *
 * The otherwise undocumented function hstore_version_diag is provided
 * for testing purposes.

	 * hstore-new, then "old" values are impossible here 4. If you're moving
	 * from pre-release hstore-new to new contrib/hstore, you're not doing so
