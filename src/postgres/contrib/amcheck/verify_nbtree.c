 *
 * For B-Tree indexes, verification includes checking that each page in the
 * target index has items in logical order as reported by an insertion scankey
 * (the insertion scankey sort-wise NULL semantics are needed for
 * verification).
 *
 * When index-to-heap verification is requested, a Bloom filter is used to
 * fingerprint all tuples in the target index, as the index is traversed to
 * verify its structure.  A heap scan later uses Bloom filter probes to verify
 * that every visible heap tuple has a matching index tuple.

 *
 * The classic example of the kind of inconsistency that we can only catch

 * point to the new right sibling page (its left link still points to the
 * original page), even though the first phase of a page split is supposed to
 * work as a single atomic action.  This subtle inconsistency will probably
 * only break backwards scans in practice.
 *
 * Note that this is the only place where amcheck will "couple" buffer locks
 * (and only for !readonly callers).  In general we prefer to avoid more
 * thorough cross-page checks in !readonly mode, but it seems worth the
 * complexity here.  Also, the performance overhead of performing lock
 * coupling here is negligible in practice.  Control only reaches here with a
 * non-corrupt index when there is a concurrent page split at the instant

		 * go to those lengths because that would be prohibitively expensive,
		 * and probably not markedly more effective in practice.
		 *
		 * On the leaf level, we check that the key is <= the highkey.

		 * item from the same level on internal levels:
		 *
		 * While the new left page's high key is copied from the first offset
		 * on the right page during an internal page split, that's not the
		 * full story.  In effect, internal pages are split in the middle of
		 * the firstright tuple, not between the would-be lastleft and
		 * firstright tuples: the firstright key ends up on the left side as
		 * left's new highkey, and the firstright downlink ends up on the
		 * right side as right's new "negative infinity" item.  The negative
		 * infinity tuple is truncated to zero attributes, so we're only left
		 * with the downlink.  In other words, the copying is just an

	 * (or left link, or downlink) and find its sibling, because recycling
	 * does not occur until no possible index scan could land on the page.
	 * Index scans can follow links with nothing more than their snapshot as
	 * an interlock and be sure of at least that much.  (See page
	 * recycling/"visible to everyone" notes in nbtree README.)
	 *
	 * Furthermore, it's okay if we follow a rightlink and find a half-dead or
	 * dead (ignorable) page one or more times.  There will either be a
	 * further right link to follow that leads to a live page before too long
	 * (before passing by parent's rightmost child), or we will find the end
	 * of the entire level instead (possible when parent page is itself the

	 * item returned here as an upper bound on target's last item.  In
	 * general, false positives are disallowed.  Avoiding them here when
	 * caller is !readonly is subtle.
	 *
	 * A concurrent page deletion by VACUUM of the target page can result in
	 * the insertion of items on to this right sibling page that would
	 * previously have been inserted on our target page.  There might have
	 * been insertions that followed the target's downlink after it was made
	 * to point to right sibling instead of target by page deletion's first
	 * phase. The inserters insert items that would belong on target page.
	 * This race is very tight, but it's possible.  This is our only problem.
	 *
	 * Non-problems:
	 *
	 * We are not hindered by a concurrent page split of the target; we'll
	 * never land on the second half of the page anyway.  A concurrent split
	 * of the right page will also not matter, because the first data item
	 * remains the same within the left half, which we'll reliably land on. If
	 * we had to skip over ignorable/deleted pages, it cannot matter because
	 * their key space has already been atomically merged with the first
	 * non-ignorable page we eventually find (doesn't matter whether the page
	 * we eventually find is a true sibling or a cousin of target, which we go
	 * into below).
	 *
	 * Solution:
	 *
	 * Caller knows that it should reverify that target is not ignorable
	 * (half-dead or deleted) when cross-page sibling item comparison appears
	 * to indicate corruption (invariant fails).  This detects the single race
	 * condition that exists for caller.  This is correct because the
	 * continued existence of target block as non-ignorable (not half-dead or
	 * deleted) implies that target page was not merged into from the right by
	 * deletion; the key space at or after target never moved left.  Target's
	 * parent either has the same downlink to target as before, or a <
	 * downlink due to deletion at the left of target.  Target either has the
	 * same highkey as before, or a highkey < before when there is a page
	 * split. (The rightmost concurrently-split-from-target-page page will
	 * still have the same highkey as target was originally found to have,
	 * which for our purposes is equivalent to target's highkey itself never
	 * changing, since we reliably skip over
	 * concurrently-split-from-target-page pages.)
	 *
	 * In simpler terms, we allow that the key space of the target may expand
	 * left (the key space can move left on the left side of target only), but
	 * the target key space cannot expand right and get ahead of us without
	 * our detecting it.  The key space of the target cannot shrink, unless it
	 * shrinks to zero due to the deletion of the original page, our canary
	 * condition.  (To be very precise, we're a bit stricter than that because
	 * it might just have been that the target page split and only the
	 * original target page was deleted.  We can be more strict, just not more
	 * lax.)
	 *
	 * Top level tree walk caller moves on to next page (makes it the new
	 * target) following recovery from this race.  (cf.  The rationale for
	 * child/downlink verification needing a ShareLock within
	 * bt_child_check(), where page deletion is also the main source of
	 * trouble.)
	 *
	 * Note that it doesn't matter if right sibling page here is actually a
	 * cousin page, because in order for the key space to be readjusted in a
	 * way that causes us issues in next level up (guiding problematic
	 * concurrent insertions to the cousin from the grandparent rather than to
	 * the sibling from the parent), there'd have to be page deletion of
	 * target's parent page (affecting target's parent's downlink in target's
	 * grandparent page).  Internal page deletion only occurs when there are
	 * no child pages (they were all fully deleted), and caller is checking
	 * that the target's parent has at least one non-deleted (so
	 * non-ignorable) child: the target page.  (Note that the first phase of
	 * deletion atomically marks the page to be deleted half-dead/ignorable at
	 * the same time downlink in its parent is removed, so caller will
	 * definitely not fail to detect that this happened.)
	 *
	 * This trick is inspired by the method backward scans use for dealing
	 * with concurrent page splits; concurrent page deletion is a problem that
	 * similarly receives special consideration sometimes (it's possible that
	 * the backwards scan will re-read its "original" block after failing to
	 * find a right-link to it, having already moved in the opposite direction
	 * (right/"forwards") a few times to try to locate one).  Just like us,
	 * that happens only to determine if there was a concurrent page deletion
	 * of a reference page, and just like us if there was a page deletion of
	 * that reference page it means we can move on from caring about the
	 * reference page.  See the nbtree README for a full description of how

 *
 * The redundancy between an index and the table it indexes provides a good
 * opportunity to detect corruption, especially corruption within the table.
 * The high level principle behind the verification performed here is that any
 * IndexTuple that should be in an index following a fresh CREATE INDEX (based
 * on the same index definition) should also have been in the original,
 * existing index, which should have used exactly the same representation
 *
 * Since the overall structure of the index has already been verified, the most
 * likely explanation for error here is a corrupt heap page (could be logical
 * or physical corruption).  Index corruption may still be detected here,
 * though.  Only readonly callers will have verified that left links and right
 * links are in agreement, and so it's possible that a leaf page transposition
 * within index is actually the source of corruption detected here (for
 * !readonly callers).  The checks performed only for readonly callers might
 * more accurately frame the problem as a cross-page invariant issue (this
 * could even be due to recovery not replaying all WAL records).  The !readonly
 * ERROR message raised here includes a HINT about retrying with readonly
 * verification, just in case it's a cross-page invariant issue, though that
 * isn't particularly likely.
 *
 * table_index_build_scan() expects to be able to find the root tuple when a
 * heap-only tuple (the live tuple at the end of some HOT chain) needs to be
 * indexed, in order to replace the actual tuple's TID with the root tuple's
 * TID (which is what we're actually passed back here).  The index build heap
 * scan code will raise an error when a tuple that claims to be the root of the
 * heap-only tuple's HOT chain cannot be located.  This catches cases where the
 * original root item offset/root tuple for a HOT chain indicates (for whatever
 * reason) that the entire HOT chain is dead, despite the fact that the latest
 * heap-only tuple should be indexed.  When this happens, sequential scans may
 * always give correct answers, and all indexes may be considered structurally
 * consistent (i.e. the nbtree structural checks would not detect corruption).
 * It may be the case that only index scans give wrong answers, and yet heap or
 * SLRU corruption is the real culprit.  (While it's true that LP_DEAD bit
 * setting will probably also leave the index in a corrupt state before too
 * long, the problem is nonetheless that there is heap corruption.)
 *
 * Heap-only tuple handling within table_index_build_scan() works in a way that
 * helps us to detect index tuples that contain the wrong values (values that
 * don't match the latest tuple in the HOT chain).  This can happen when there
 * is no superseding index tuple due to a faulty assessment of HOT safety,
 * perhaps during the original CREATE INDEX.  Because the latest tuple's
 * contents are used with the root TID, an error will be raised when a tuple
 * with the same TID but non-matching attribute values is passed back to us.
 * Faulty assessment of HOT-safety was behind at least two distinct CREATE
 * INDEX CONCURRENTLY bugs that made it into stable releases, one of which was
 * undetected for many years.  In short, the same principle that allows a
 * REINDEX to repair corruption when there was an (undetected) broken HOT chain
 * also allows us to detect the corruption in many cases.
