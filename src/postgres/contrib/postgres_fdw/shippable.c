 *	  Determine which database objects are shippable to a remote server.
 *
 * We need to determine whether particular functions, operators, and indeed
 * data types are shippable to a remote server for execution --- that is,
 * do they exist and have the same behavior remotely as they do locally?
 * Built-in objects are generally considered shippable.  Other objects can
 * be shipped if they are declared as such by the user.
 *
 * Note: there are additional filter rules that prevent shipping mutable
 * functions or functions using nonportable collations.  Those considerations
 * need not be accounted for here.
