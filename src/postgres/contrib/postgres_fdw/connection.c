 * Connection cache hash table entry

 * The lookup key in this hash table is the user mapping OID. We use just one
 * connection per user mapping ID, which ensures that all the scans use the
 * same snapshot during a query.  Using the user mapping OID rather than
 * the foreign server OID + user OID avoids creating multiple connections when
 * the public user mapping applies to all user OIDs.
 *
 * The "conn" pointer can be NULL if we don't currently have a live connection.
 * When we do have a connection, xact_depth tracks the current depth of
 * transactions and subtransactions open on the remote side.  We need to issue
 * commands at the same nesting depth on the remote as we're executing at
 * ourselves, so that rolling back a subtransaction will kill the right
 * queries and not the wrong ones.
