passwordcheck_extra
===================

Development
-----------

passwordcheck_extra is a fork of passwordcheck, contrib module to check
a password quality using a fork of PostgreSQL core.

There are two ways to compile and install the code:
1) Copy it as contrib/passwordcheck_extra in PostgreSQL code and use the
following command:
make install
2) Include PostgreSQL libraries in LD_LIBRARY_PATH and use the following
command:
make USE_PGXS=1
make USE_PGXS=1 install

Regression tests can be run as follows:
1) Module copied in contrib of PostgreSQL:
make check
make installcheck # Run on existing server
2) Module managed independently, needs a server already running.
make installcheck USE_PGXS=1 # Run on existing server

In order to install it, install the library to server, add the following
parameter value to postgresql.conf and restart server.
shared_preload_libraries = '$libdir/passwordcheck_extra'

Features
--------

This module strengthens the minimum password requirement it should have
at creation with a user-defined policy:
- passwordcheck_extra.special_chars, to define a list of special characters
  with the password needing at least one. Default is "!@#$%^&*()_+{}|<>?=".
- passwordcheck_extra.restrict_lower, to enforce the use of at least one
  lower-case character.
- passwordcheck_extra.restrict_upper, to enforce the use of at least one
  upper-case character.
- passwordcheck_extra.restrict_numbers, to enforce the use of at least
  one number.
- passwordcheck_extra.restrict_special, to enforce the use of at least
  one special character listed in \"passwordcheck_extra.special_chars\".
- passwordcheck_extra.minimum_length, minimum length of password allowed.
  Default is 8, which likely sucks.
- passwordcheck_extra.maximum_length, maximum length of password allowed.
  Default is 15, which definitely sucks, but it is useful for tests.

YB note:
passwordcheck has been replaced by passwordcheck_extra.
However the name of the plugin continues to be passwordcheck because the team
decided that it will be confusing to have two plugins for the same function.

The steps followed to replace the plugin are:

* Choose commit referred below as subsequent commits add support for PG15.
* Overwrite passwordcheck.c with passwordcheck_extra.c (using cp)
* Remove all occurrences of "_extra" as the name of the plugin is unchanged.

Tests from passwordcheck (with some changes) and passwordcheck_extra are also
run.
