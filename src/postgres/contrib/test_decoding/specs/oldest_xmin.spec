# Checkpoint with following get_changes forces xmin advancement. We do
# get_changes twice because if one more xl_running_xacts record had slipped
# before our CHECKPOINT, xmin will be advanced only on this record, thus not
# reaching value needed for vacuuming corresponding pg_attribute entry. ALTER of
# composite type is a rare form of DDL which allows T1 to see the tuple which
# will be removed (xmax set) before T1 commits. That is, interlocking doesn't
# forbid modifying catalog after someone read it (and didn't commit yet).
