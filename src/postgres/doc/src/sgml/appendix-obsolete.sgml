<appendix id="appendix-obsolete">
 <title>Obsolete or Renamed Features</title>

 <para>
   Functionality is sometimes removed from PostgreSQL, feature, setting
   and file names sometimes change, or documentation moves to different
   places. This section directs users coming from old versions of the
   documentation or from external links to the appropriate new location
   for the information they need.
 </para>

 <!--
  This section exists so that people following /current/ links to documentation
  don't get a 404 when we move or rename things. And users who find old versions
  of the docs in searches or old command names when checking the index can
  follow links to the new commands.

  Each subsection here should retain the same <chapter>, <appendix> and/or
  <sect1> "id" attribute that was used for the relevant documentation before
  it was renamed or moved. Do not prepend "obsolete-" or anything, keep it
  exactly the same. These ids are used to determine the filenames for generated
  HTML docs so changing them will break links.

  Each entry should also insert index terms redirecting from the old to new
  names. The recommended spelling is

      <indexterm><primary>oldname</primary><see>newname</see></indexterm>

  We don't bother with attempting to maintain down-version linking, e.g from
  pg_waldump to pg_xlogdump. Users of old versions should use old docs. There
  is no need to add index terms pointing from the new to old names.
