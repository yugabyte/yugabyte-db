Typical markup:

\-\-?[A-Za-z_]+[-A-Za-z_]*      <option> (use backslashes to avoid SGML markup)

        We cannot use UTF8 because back branches still use SGML Docbook,
        which does not support it.  Also, rendering engines have to
        support the referenced characters.

        Do not use numeric _UTF_ numeric character escapes (&#nnn;),
        we can only use Latin1.

        Example: Alvaro Herrera is &Aacute;lvaro Herrera
        Find non-ASCII characters (remove 'X'):
             grep -X-color='auto' -P -n "[\x80-\xFF]"

<appendix id="release">
 <title>Release Notes</title>

  <para>
   The release notes contain the significant changes in each
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> release, with major features and migration
   issues listed at the top.  The release notes do not contain changes
   that affect only a few users or changes that are internal and therefore not
   user-visible.  For example, the optimizer is improved in almost every
   release, but the improvements are usually observed by users as simply
   faster queries.
  </para>

  <para>
   A complete list of changes for each release can be obtained by
   viewing the <link linkend="git">Git</link> logs for each release.
   The <ulink
   url="https://www.postgresql.org/list/pgsql-committers/"><literal>pgsql-committers</literal>
   email list</ulink> records all source code changes as well.  There is also
   a <ulink url="https://git.postgresql.org/gitweb/?p=postgresql.git;a=summary">web
   interface</ulink> that shows changes to specific files.
  </para>

  <para>
   The name appearing next to each item represents the major developer for
   that item.  Of course all changes involve community discussion and patch
   review, so each item is truly a community effort.
  </para>

<!--
  When beginning a new major-release series, create a new release-NN.sgml
  file, removing the previous one, and change the &-reference here.
  Don't forget to update filelist.sgml.

  The reason for keeping each branch's release notes in a differently-named
  file is to reduce confusion when preparing minor-release updates.
  All the active branches have to be edited concurrently when doing that.
