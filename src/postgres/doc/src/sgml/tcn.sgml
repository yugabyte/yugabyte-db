 <para>
  The <filename>tcn</filename> module provides a trigger function that notifies
  listeners of changes to any table on which it is attached.  It must be
  used as an <literal>AFTER</literal> trigger <literal>FOR EACH ROW</literal>.
 </para>

 <para>
  This module is considered <quote>trusted</quote>, that is, it can be
  installed by non-superusers who have <literal>CREATE</literal> privilege
  on the current database.
 </para>

 <para>
  Only one parameter may be supplied to the function in a
  <literal>CREATE TRIGGER</literal> statement, and that is optional.  If supplied
  it will be used for the channel name for the notifications.  If omitted
  <literal>tcn</literal> will be used for the channel name.
 </para>

 <para>
  The payload of the notifications consists of the table name, a letter to
  indicate which type of operation was performed, and column name/value pairs
  for primary key columns.  Each part is separated from the next by a comma.
  For ease of parsing using regular expressions, table and column names are
  always wrapped in double quotes, and data values are always wrapped in
  single quotes.  Embedded quotes are doubled.
 </para>

 <para>
  A brief example of using the extension follows.
