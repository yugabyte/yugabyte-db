 <para>
  This chapter explains what just-in-time compilation is, and how it can be
  configured in <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>.

 <sect1 id="jit-reason">
  <title>What Is <acronym>JIT</acronym> compilation?</title>

  <para>
   Just-in-Time (<acronym>JIT</acronym>) compilation is the process of turning
   some form of interpreted program evaluation into a native program, and
   doing so at run time.
   For example, instead of using general-purpose code that can evaluate
   arbitrary SQL expressions to evaluate a particular SQL predicate
   like <literal>WHERE a.col = 3</literal>, it is possible to generate a
   function that is specific to that expression and can be natively executed
   by the CPU, yielding a speedup.
  </para>

  <para>
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> has builtin support to perform
   <acronym>JIT</acronym> compilation using <ulink
   url="https://llvm.org/"><productname>LLVM</productname></ulink> when
   <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> is built with
   <link linkend="configure-with-llvm"><literal>--with-llvm</literal></link>.
  </para>

  <sect2 id="jit-accelerated-operations">
   <title><acronym>JIT</acronym> Accelerated Operations</title>
   <para>
    Currently <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s <acronym>JIT</acronym>
    implementation has support for accelerating expression evaluation and
    tuple deforming.  Several other operations could be accelerated in the
    future.
   </para>
   <para>
    Expression evaluation is used to evaluate <literal>WHERE</literal>
    clauses, target lists, aggregates and projections. It can be accelerated
    by generating code specific to each case.
   </para>
   <para>
    Tuple deforming is the process of transforming an on-disk tuple (see <xref
    linkend="storage-tuple-layout"/>) into its in-memory representation.
    It can be accelerated by creating a function specific to the table layout
    and the number of columns to be extracted.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="jit-inlining">
   <title>Inlining</title>
   <para>
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> is very extensible and allows new
    data types, functions, operators and other database objects to be defined;
    see <xref linkend="extend"/>. In fact the built-in objects are implemented
    using nearly the same mechanisms.  This extensibility implies some
    overhead, for example due to function calls (see <xref linkend="xfunc"/>).
    To reduce that overhead, <acronym>JIT</acronym> compilation can inline the
    bodies of small functions into the expressions using them. That allows a
    significant percentage of the overhead to be optimized away.
   </para>
  </sect2>

  <sect2 id="jit-optimization">
   <title>Optimization</title>
   <para>
    <productname>LLVM</productname> has support for optimizing generated
    code. Some of the optimizations are cheap enough to be performed whenever
    <acronym>JIT</acronym> is used, while others are only beneficial for
    longer-running queries.
    See <ulink url="https://llvm.org/docs/Passes.html#transform-passes"/> for
    more details about optimizations.
   </para>
  </sect2>

 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="jit-decision">
  <title>When to <acronym>JIT</acronym>?</title>

  <para>
   <acronym>JIT</acronym> compilation is beneficial primarily for long-running
   CPU-bound queries. Frequently these will be analytical queries.  For short
   queries the added overhead of performing <acronym>JIT</acronym> compilation
   will often be higher than the time it can save.
  </para>

  <para>
   To determine whether <acronym>JIT</acronym> compilation should be used,
   the total estimated cost of a query (see
   <xref linkend="planner-stats-details"/> and
   <xref linkend="runtime-config-query-constants"/>) is used.
   The estimated cost of the query will be compared with the setting of <xref
   linkend="guc-jit-above-cost"/>. If the cost is higher,
   <acronym>JIT</acronym> compilation will be performed.
   Two further decisions are then needed.
   Firstly, if the estimated cost is more
   than the setting of <xref linkend="guc-jit-inline-above-cost"/>, short
   functions and operators used in the query will be inlined.
   Secondly, if the estimated cost is more than the setting of <xref
   linkend="guc-jit-optimize-above-cost"/>, expensive optimizations are
   applied to improve the generated code.
   Each of these options increases the <acronym>JIT</acronym> compilation
   overhead, but can reduce query execution time considerably.
  </para>

  <para>
   These cost-based decisions will be made at plan time, not execution
   time. This means that when prepared statements are in use, and a generic
   plan is used (see <xref linkend="sql-prepare"/>), the values of the
   configuration parameters in effect at prepare time control the decisions,
   not the settings at execution time.
  </para>

  <note>
   <para>
    If <xref linkend="guc-jit"/> is set to <literal>off</literal>, or if no
    <acronym>JIT</acronym> implementation is available (for example because
    the server was compiled without <literal>--with-llvm</literal>),
    <acronym>JIT</acronym> will not be performed, even if it would be
    beneficial based on the above criteria.  Setting <xref linkend="guc-jit"/>
    to <literal>off</literal> has effects at both plan and execution time.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   <xref linkend="sql-explain"/> can be used to see whether
   <acronym>JIT</acronym> is used or not.  As an example, here is a query that
   is not using <acronym>JIT</acronym>:
<screen>
=# EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT SUM(relpages) FROM pg_class;
                                                 QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------&zwsp;------------------------------------------
 Aggregate  (cost=16.27..16.29 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=0.303..0.303 rows=1 loops=1)
   ->  Seq Scan on pg_class  (cost=0.00..15.42 rows=342 width=4) (actual time=0.017..0.111 rows=356 loops=1)
 Planning Time: 0.116 ms
 Execution Time: 0.365 ms
(4 rows)
</screen>
   Given the cost of the plan, it is entirely reasonable that no
   <acronym>JIT</acronym> was used; the cost of <acronym>JIT</acronym> would
   have been bigger than the potential savings. Adjusting the cost limits
   will lead to <acronym>JIT</acronym> use:
<screen>
=# SET jit_above_cost = 10;
SET
=# EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT SUM(relpages) FROM pg_class;
                                                 QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------&zwsp;------------------------------------------
 Aggregate  (cost=16.27..16.29 rows=1 width=8) (actual time=6.049..6.049 rows=1 loops=1)
   ->  Seq Scan on pg_class  (cost=0.00..15.42 rows=342 width=4) (actual time=0.019..0.052 rows=356 loops=1)
 Planning Time: 0.133 ms
 JIT:
   Functions: 3
   Options: Inlining false, Optimization false, Expressions true, Deforming true
   Timing: Generation 1.259 ms, Inlining 0.000 ms, Optimization 0.797 ms, Emission 5.048 ms, Total 7.104 ms
 Execution Time: 7.416 ms
</screen>
   As visible here, <acronym>JIT</acronym> was used, but inlining and
   expensive optimization were not. If <xref
   linkend="guc-jit-inline-above-cost"/> or <xref
   linkend="guc-jit-optimize-above-cost"/> were also lowered,
   that would change.
  </para>
 </sect1>

 <sect1 id="jit-configuration" xreflabel="JIT Configuration">
  <title>Configuration</title>

  <para>
   The configuration variable
   <xref linkend="guc-jit"/> determines whether <acronym>JIT</acronym>
   compilation is enabled or disabled.
   If it is enabled, the configuration variables
   <xref linkend="guc-jit-above-cost"/>, <xref
   linkend="guc-jit-inline-above-cost"/>, and <xref
   linkend="guc-jit-optimize-above-cost"/> determine
   whether <acronym>JIT</acronym> compilation is performed for a query,
   and how much effort is spent doing so.
  </para>

  <para>
   <xref linkend="guc-jit-provider"/> determines which <acronym>JIT</acronym>
   implementation is used. It is rarely required to be changed. See <xref
   linkend="jit-pluggable"/>.
  </para>

  <para>
   For development and debugging purposes a few additional configuration
   parameters exist, as described in
   <xref linkend="runtime-config-developer"/>.

  <sect2 id="jit-extensibility-bitcode">
   <title>Inlining Support for Extensions</title>
   <para>
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname>'s <acronym>JIT</acronym>
    implementation can inline the bodies of functions
    of types <literal>C</literal> and <literal>internal</literal>, as well as
    operators based on such functions.  To do so for functions in extensions,
    the definitions of those functions need to be made available.
    When using <link linkend="extend-pgxs">PGXS</link> to build an extension
    against a server that has been compiled with LLVM JIT support, the
    relevant files will be built and installed automatically.
   </para>

   <para>
    The relevant files have to be installed into
    <filename>$pkglibdir/bitcode/$extension/</filename> and a summary of them
    into <filename>$pkglibdir/bitcode/$extension.index.bc</filename>, where
    <literal>$pkglibdir</literal> is the directory returned by
    <literal>pg_config --pkglibdir</literal> and <literal>$extension</literal>
    is the base name of the extension's shared library.

    <note>
     <para>
      For functions built into <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> itself,
      the bitcode is installed into
      <literal>$pkglibdir/bitcode/postgres</literal>.

  <sect2 id="jit-pluggable">
   <title>Pluggable <acronym>JIT</acronym> Providers</title>

   <para>
    <productname>PostgreSQL</productname> provides a <acronym>JIT</acronym>
    implementation based on <productname>LLVM</productname>.  The interface to
    the <acronym>JIT</acronym> provider is pluggable and the provider can be
    changed without recompiling (although currently, the build process only
    provides inlining support data for <productname>LLVM</productname>).
    The active provider is chosen via the setting
    <xref linkend="guc-jit-provider"/>.
   </para>

   <sect3>
    <title><acronym>JIT</acronym> Provider Interface</title>
    <para>
     A <acronym>JIT</acronym> provider is loaded by dynamically loading the
     named shared library. The normal library search path is used to locate
     the library. To provide the required <acronym>JIT</acronym> provider
     callbacks and to indicate that the library is actually a
     <acronym>JIT</acronym> provider, it needs to provide a C function named
     <function>_PG_jit_provider_init</function>. This function is passed a
     struct that needs to be filled with the callback function pointers for
     individual actions:
<programlisting>
struct JitProviderCallbacks
{
    JitProviderResetAfterErrorCB reset_after_error;
    JitProviderReleaseContextCB release_context;
    JitProviderCompileExprCB compile_expr;
};

extern void _PG_jit_provider_init(JitProviderCallbacks *cb);
