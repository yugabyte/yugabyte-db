# PGAC_PATH_PYTHON
# ----------------
# Look for Python and set the output variable 'PYTHON' if found,
# fail otherwise.
#
# Since we are supporting only Python 3.x, prefer python3 to plain python.  If
# the latter exists at all, it very possibly points to python2.

# As the Python 3 transition happens and PEP 394 isn't updated, we
# need to cater to systems that don't have unversioned "python" by
# default.  Some systems ship with "python3" by default and perhaps
# have "python" in an optional package.  Some systems only have
# "python2" and "python3", in which case it's reasonable to prefer the
# newer version.

# Set python_libdir to the path of the directory containing the Python shared
# library.  Set python_libspec to the -L/-l linker switches needed to link it.
# Set python_additional_libs to contain any additional linker switches needed
# for subsidiary libraries.
#
# In modern, well-configured Python installations, LIBDIR gives the correct
# directory name and LDLIBRARY is the file name of the shlib.  But in older
# installations LDLIBRARY is frequently a useless path fragment, and it's also
# possible that the shlib is in a standard library directory such as /usr/lib
# so that LIBDIR is irrelevant.  Also, some packagers put the .so symlink for
# the shlib in ${python_configdir} even though Python itself never does.
# We must also check that what we found is a shared library not a plain
# library, which we do by checking its extension.  (We used to rely on
# Py_ENABLE_SHARED, but that only tells us that a shlib exists, not that
# we found it.)
