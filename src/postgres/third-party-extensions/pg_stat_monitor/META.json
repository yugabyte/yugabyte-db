   "description": "pg_stat_monitor is a PostgreSQL Query Performance Monitoring tool, based on PostgreSQL's contrib module pg_stat_statements. PostgreSQLâ€™s pg_stat_statements provides the basic statistics, which is sometimes not enough. The major shortcoming in pg_stat_statements is that it accumulates all the queries and their statistics and does not provide aggregated statistics nor histogram information. In this case, a user would need to calculate the aggregates, which is quite an expensive operation.",
