pgTAP 1.3.3
============

[pgTAP](https://pgtap.org) is a unit testing framework for PostgreSQL written
in PL/pgSQL and PL/SQL. It includes a comprehensive collection of
[TAP](https://testanything.org)-emitting assertion functions, as well as the
ability to integrate with other TAP-emitting test frameworks. It can also be
used in the xUnit testing style. For detailed documentation, see the
documentation in `doc/pgtap.mmd` or
[online](https://pgtap.org/documentation.html "Complete pgTAP Documentation").

pgTAP must be installed on a host with PostgreSQL server running; it cannot
be installed remotely.

To build it, just do this:

    make
    make install
    make installcheck

If you encounter an error such as:

    "Makefile", line 8: Need an operator

You need to use GNU make, which may well be installed on your system as
`gmake`:

    gmake
    gmake install
    gmake installcheck

If you encounter an error such as:

    make: pg_config: Command not found

Or:

    Makefile:52: *** pgTAP requires PostgreSQL 9.1 or later. This is .  Stop.

Be sure that you have `pg_config` installed and in your path. If you used a
package management system such as RPM to install PostgreSQL, be sure that the
`-devel` package is also installed. If necessary tell the build process where
to find it:

    env PG_CONFIG=/path/to/pg_config make && make install && make installcheck

And finally, if all that fails, copy the entire distribution directory to the
`contrib/` subdirectory of the PostgreSQL source tree and try it there without
`pg_config`:

    env NO_PGXS=1 make && make install && make installcheck

If you encounter an error such as:

    ERROR:  must be owner of database regression

You need to run the test suite using a super user, such as the default
"postgres" super user:

    make installcheck PGUSER=postgres

If you encounter an error such as:

    ERROR: Missing extensions required for testing: citext isn ltree

Install the PostgreSQL
[Additional Supplied Modules](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/contrib.html),
which are required to run the tests. If you used a package management system
such as RPM to install PostgreSQL, install the `-contrib` package.

Once pgTAP is installed, you can add it to a database by connecting as a super
user and running:

    CREATE EXTENSION pgtap;

If you've upgraded your cluster to PostgreSQL 9.1 and already had pgTAP
installed, you can upgrade it to a properly packaged extension with:

    CREATE EXTENSION pgtap FROM unpackaged;

If you want to install pgTAP and all of its supporting objects into a specific
schema, use the `SCHEMA` clause to specify the schema, like so:

    CREATE EXTENSION pgtap SCHEMA tap;

Dependencies
------------

pgTAP requires PostgreSQL 9.1 or higher.
