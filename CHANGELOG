1.2.0
-- Bug fix: Make child table lookups more intelligent to be able to deal with schemas being in the current search_path. Functions this affects are: drop_time_partition(), drop_id_partition(), reapply_privileges(), undo_partition(), undo_partition_id(), undo_partition_time(). Before table names may not have matched properly when looping through all tables to drop or reset privileges. Thanks to https://github.com/terrorobe for reporting this issue.
-- Bug fix: reapply_privileges() had unconditional calls to pg_jobmon functions and would fail if it wasn't installed.
-- Added new parameter to drop partition functions to manually set an interval you'd like to drop. Makes it easier to cleanup a bunch of old partitions you don't need anymore without having to go through the whole retention policy setup if that's not needed.
-- Renamed drop_time_partition() to drop_partition_time() and drop_id_partition() to drop_partition_id() to be more consistent with the other function names. Please check function ownership & privileges before and after update to ensure they are reset properly.


1.1.0
-- New python scripts in extras folder to allow partition creation and undoing using smaller commit batches, as is suggested in the documentation for the partition_data_* and undo_partition_* functions. This helps avoid transaction locks when there is a large amount of data to move around. There are also options to commit more slowly and ease the load on very busy systems.
-- Changed the ordering of batch arguments in partition_data_id() & partition_data_time(). This makes their order the same as the undo functions and is a more sensical order (I think anyway).
-- Made partition functions quieter. No more notices and just returns number of rows moved.
-- Changed the undo partition functions to remove partitions in the order they were originally created. They were doing it alphabetically before, which could cause an odd order for serial based partitioning (p100 would be before p2). Creation order may not remove them in ascending order of the data at first, which would be ideal, but it makes more sense than alphabetically.
-- Bug fix: undo_partition() could return 0 prematurely if some of the partitions were empty. Will now automatically uninherit/drop any empty partitions and continue on if there are still child tables, not counting them against p_batch_count if given.


1.0.0
-- New functions to undo partitioning. These all either move or copy data from the child tables and put it into the parent. All have an option to allow you either uninherit the child tables (default) or drop them when all their data has been put into the parent.
    --  undo_partition_time() & undo_partition_id are functions that move the data from the child partitions to the parent tables. Data is deleted from the child table and inserted to the parent. These functions allow smaller interval batches to be given as a parameter and are better able to handle larger partitioning sets. 
    -- undo_partition() can work on an any parent/child table set in PostgreSQL, not just partition sets created by pg_partman. Just pass it the name of the parent table. This method only copies the data out of the child tables instead of deleting it, allowing you to keep all the partitioned data if desired. Because of this it can only process an entire partition at a time and cannot handle batches smaller than the partition interval.
-- Changed create_prev_id_partition() to partition_data_id() & create_prev_time_partition() to partition_data_time(). This clarifies what these actually do since they don't always create a partition nor is it always necessarily "previous" data.
-- Changed how the above functions work to move data from parent into partitions. You can now feed them a smaller interval value for the rows that you'd like moved instead of it always moving exactly one entire partition of data. This allows smaller batch sizes when you've got a lot of data even in just one partition. That interval is now the second parameter. A third parameter can tell it how many of those interval batches you'd like to move in a single run of the function. Both of these parameters are optional. If not given, the interval defaults to the partition interval and the batch count is one (so it works exactly like it used to with no parameters but the parent table given). 
-- Partition premake system is now able to catch up if it falls behind for some reason. Also makes it so that if the premake value is increased, within the next few runs it will have that many partitions premade automatically.
-- Bug fix: create_time_partition() & create_time_function() now handle the "timestamp with time zone" data type much better. Was getting some mismatches in the trigger rules and table constraints when timestamptz was in use on server not running in UTC/GMT time. Would cause constraint violations during data insert at certain time boundaries. If you ran into this issue, there are two ways to fix it: 1) Manually recreate the constraints for the most recent partitions and any future partitions already created. You may have to move some data around as well. 2) Use the new undo functions to move all the data back into the parent table and then repartition again using the partition_data_* functions. This will fix the issue for all partitions.
-- Bug fix: Determining how many partitions to premake in run_maintenance() is now more accurate. Previous date math would occasionally premake 1 extra partition depending on the time differences. This can still occur with weekly partitioning due to differing month lengths (especially February) and daylight savings. Doesn't hurt anything and will self-correct.
-- Much more complete pgTAP test suite.


0.4.2
-- The static partitioning trigger function can now handle partitions based on the configured premake value. For example, the default premake value is 4 so it can now handle data for the current partition, 4 previous partitions and 4 future partitions. Changing the premake value will cause the trigger function to be changed appropriately the next time a partition is automatically created. Except for initial setup, at no time does the automated partitioning system create old partitions (see the create_prev_* functions if you need to do this). If you change the premake value and there is no previous partition for it to put data in, it will go to the parent table.
-- create_parent() now accounts for the new static partitioning rules. For time-static, it will create the current partition as well as previous and future partitions equal to the configured premake number (default premake being 4, you will end up with 9 partitions). For id-static, it will only create previous partitions if the resulting rules handle id values greater than zero. So if you're starting from zero you will only have future partitions created, and no previous.
-- Constraint now ensures that premake value is greater than zero.
-- create_parent() now ensures interval value for serial partitioning is greater than zero.
-- Much more extensive pgTAP tests.


0.4.1
-- Changed the privilege management system to apply the current parent's privileges only to new child tables at the time they're created. No longer re-applies privileges to existing child tables. When partition sets grew large, this was causing serious performance problems and was too expensive an operation to run every time a child was created.
-- Dropped apply_grants() function. New child table privileges are now managed by the partition creation functions themselves.
-- Created reapply_privileges() function to reset the privileges of all child tables in a given partition set. Uses the given parent's privileges at the time the function is run. All new grants will be set and all that don't exist will be revoked. Ownership will be updated if it has changed.
-- First round of pgTAP tests.


0.4.0
-- No separate configuration required for setting privileges on child tables anymore. Grants config table has been dropped. Please apply the grants you need to the parent table and they will be set for all children using that. Note that unlike before, privilges that don't exist on the parent will now be revoked from all child tables.
-- create_parent() now enforces that a given parent table be schema qualified. Ensures that a custom search_path doesn't affect the wrong table by accident.
-- Removed enum custom type and replace with check function.
-- Applying of grants is now logged in pg_jobmon so if there's any issues with that step, it's clear where it failed.


0.3.2
-- Allow multiple grant commands for the same partition set in case different roles need different grants. Removed primary key constraint from part_grants table and updated apply_grants function 
-- create_parent() function now ensures that the control column has a not null constraint.
-- Make select-only functions STABLE


0.3.1
-- Added check to dynamic id & time trigger functions to see if target table exists. If it doesn't, insert to parent instead of throwing error. Better than losing data! check_parent() function can monitor for this happening and create_prev_* functions can easily fix it. Thought of having it auto-create the needed partition, but if something is going wrong, that could end up creating a lot of unwanted partitions and be harder to clean up. 


0.3.0
-- Added grants configuration table to propagate permissions to newly created child partitions. Will also apply those permissions to the parent table and all existing child tables whenever a new partition is created. Permissions are only granted, never revoked. See docs for more info.


0.2.0
-- New functions to manage dropping old partitions. Does not actually need to be called directly unless necessary. Use run_maintenance() function.
-- Added ability to run_maintenance() function to manage dropping old tables in addition to managing time-based partitioning.
-- Removed raise notice in run_maintenance and make sure old search path is reset after function finishes running.
-- Lot of documentation updates


0.1.2
-- Added support for quarterly time partitioning (trickier than it first appeared)
-- Fixed bug in run_maintenance() that would give an invalid cast to integer error.
-- Fixed some calls to pg_jobmon that were outside the checks to see if it's actually installed
-- Properly reset search path back to original before partman functions were run if pg_jobmon is being used
-- Changed the default premake to 4 instead of 3. This will cause pg_jobmon's default monitoring for 3 consecutive failing jobs to trigger an before the last premade partition is used up.
-- Added optional jobmon logging to run_maintenance() so that if it fails, pg_jobmon can notify that maintenance didn't work.


0.1.1
-- Only re-create partition functions if a new partition is made.
