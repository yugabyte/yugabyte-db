# Script which, when run from Jenkins, will hunt and kill any other jenkins
# processes running on the same machine from a different build.
#
# This is done by looking for all of the processes owned by the jenkins user,
# checking their BUILD_ID environment variable, and killing any whose BUILD_ID
# does not match the current $BUILD_ID environment.  This assumes that there are
# no concurrent builds configured in Jenkins, for obvious reasons.
#
# Set $DRY_RUN before running this script to just see what would be killed.
