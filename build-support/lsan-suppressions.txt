# When we push down PG/YSQL expression execution we prepare long-lived, thread-local memory
# contexts in DocDB to use for evaluating the expressions. These contexts are never deleted, only
# reset, so LSAN/ASAN reports it as a leak for relevant PG/YSQL tests.

# Regular expressions are allocated outside of a memory context. They have to be manually cleaned
# up. When regular expressions are used in ysql_ident.conf, they are freed upon the reload of the
# file but not upon the shutdown since all the memory allocated by the process is anyways going to
# get freed. LSAN/ASAN reports it as a leak.
# Starting PG 16 (future release as of 08/2023), regular expressions will also be allocated within a
# memory context, so this suppression will not be needed.
