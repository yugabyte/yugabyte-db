title: ClusterNodeSpec
description: Node settings (like CPU / memory) for each node in the cluster. The node settings configured at top-level are uniform settings for both tserver and master nodes. Granular settings for tserver and master (honoured if dedicated_nodes is true or this is k8s cluster) are available for certain node properties. Granular settings can also be overridden per Availability Zone. This is part of ClusterSpec.
