# fileName: The location of the Prometheus
# Config File that is being created by this template.
# We recommend keeping this file in the same folder
# path where you have other config files pertaining to
# the Yugabyte platform (must be an absolute file path).

# storagePath: If you want to keep your prometheus data
# in a NAS location or mount path with a lot of storage,
# change this parameter in the service file to dictate
# which location you want to use. Keep in mind that
# Prometheus data grows quickly as you have more
# universes (must be an absolute directory path).

# scrapeInterval: The interval of time between the Prometheus
# instance scraping for database metrics on the Yugabyte Platform
# instance. Defaults to 15s, override if you wish for Prometheus
# to scrape for metrics at a faster or slower rate.

# evaluationInterval: The interval of time between the Prometheus
# instance scraping for evaluation metrics on the Yugabyte Platform
# instance. Defaults to 15s, override if you wish for Prometheus
# to scrape for evaluation metrics at a faster or slower rate.

# scrapeTimeout: The time threshold for inactivity after which the
# Prometheus instance will stop scraping for database metrics on the
# Yugabyte Platform instance. Defaults to 10s, override if you wish
# for the inactivity threshold to be longer or shorter.

# externalPort: The external port that is used by the running
# Prometheus instance. Defaults to 9090, override if you have opened
# up a different port that you wish to use for running Prometheus.

# maxConcurrency: The maximum number of concurrent queries
# that can be executed by the running Prometheus instance as
# it scrapes for metrics. Defaults to 20, override if you wish
# for the number of concurrent queries executable by Prometheus
# to be higher or lower.

# maxSamples: The maximum number of samples that a single
# Prometheus query can load into memory. Defaults to 5000000,
# override if you wish for the maximum number of samples loadable
# by a single Prometheus query to be higher or lower.

# timeout: The time threshold for inactivity after which the
# Prometheus service will be declared inactive. Defaults to 30s,
# override if you wish for the inactivity threshold to be longer or
# shorter.
