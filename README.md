# What is YugabyteDB?

YugabyteDB is a PostgreSQL-compatible, [high-performance](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/benchmark/), cloud-native, [distributed SQL](https://www.yugabyte.com/tech/distributed-sql/) database. It combines the benefits of traditional relational databases with the scalability of NoSQL systems, making it suitable for applications that require both transactional consistency and the ability to handle large amounts of data. It is best suited for cloud-native OLTP (that is, real-time, business-critical) applications that need absolute data correctness and require at least one of the following: scalability, high tolerance to failures, or globally-distributed deployments.

# Core Features

* **[Powerful RDBMS capabilities](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/explore/ysql-language-features/)** Yugabyte SQL (*YSQL* for short) reuses the PostgreSQL query layer (similar to Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL), thereby supporting most of its features (datatypes, queries, expressions, operators and functions, stored procedures, triggers, extensions, and so on).

* **[Distributed transactions](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/architecture/transactions/)** The transaction design is based on the Google Spanner architecture. Strong consistency of writes is achieved by using Raft consensus for replication and cluster-wide distributed ACID transactions using *hybrid logical clocks*. *Snapshot*, *serializable* and *read committed* isolation levels are supported. Reads (queries) have strong consistency by default, but can be tuned dynamically to read from followers and read replicas.

* **[Continuous availability](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/explore/fault-tolerance/)** YugabyteDB is extremely resilient to common outages with native failover and repair. YugabyteDB can be configured to tolerate disk, rack, node, zone, region, and cloud failures automatically. For a typical deployment where a YugabyteDB cluster is deployed in one region across multiple zones on a public cloud, the RPO is 0 (meaning no data is lost on failure) and the RTO is 3 seconds (meaning the data being served by the failed node is available in 3 seconds).

* **[Horizontal scalability](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/explore/linear-scalability/)** Scaling a YugabyteDB cluster to achieve more IOPS or data storage is as simple as adding nodes to the cluster.

* **[Geo-distributed, multi-cloud](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/develop/multi-cloud/)** YugabyteDB can be deployed in public clouds and natively inside Kubernetes. It supports deployments that span three or more fault domains, such as multi-zone, multi-rack, multi-region, and multi-cloud deployments. It also supports xCluster asynchronous replication with unidirectional master-slave and bidirectional multi-master configurations in two-region deployments. Read replicas are also a supported to serve (stale) data with low latencies.

* **[Multi API design](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/api)** The YugabyteDB query layer is built to be extensible. Currently, YugabyteDB supports two distributed SQL APIs: [Yugabyte SQL (YSQL)](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/api/ysql/), a fully relational API that re-uses the PostgreSQL query layer, and [Yugabyte Cloud QL (YCQL)](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/api/ycql/), a semi-relational SQL-like API with documents/indexing support with Apache Cassandra QL roots.

* **[100% open source](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db)** YugabyteDB is fully open-source under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://github.com/yugabyte/yugabyte-db/blob/master/LICENSE.md). The open-source version has powerful enterprise features such as distributed backups, encryption of data at rest, in-flight TLS encryption, change data capture, read replicas, and more.

YugabyteDB was created with several key design goals in mind, aiming to address the challenges faced by modern, cloud-native applications while maintaining the familiarity and power of traditional relational databases. Read more about these in our [Design goals](https://docs.yugabyte.com/preview/architecture/design-goals/).
