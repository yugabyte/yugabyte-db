    // became very complicated, and would have required enhancement to tab handling for characters
    // that display in two columns. To reduce the maintenance burden, we now pick 157 columns as the
    // width and simply use the raw output of sdiff. This will give either side of the diff around
    // 77 characters of width. For realistic files, this will generally lead to clipping on at least
    // one side, so we can show a side-by-side diff, which many developers find useful, but without
    // any confusion caused by clipping that happens only rarely. Why the odd numbers though? If
    // you're in a terminal with 8-column tab stops, this causes the RHS to begin at a tab stop
    // which will make the LHS and the RHS identical when the input files have embedded tabs.
