  /*
   * Lazy evaluation in Postgres is an optimization to save memory and possibly computation in cases
   * when an SQL function is supposed to return the results of the last statement (and it is a
   * SELECT) and the caller of the SQL function doesn't require all results from the function at
   * once.
   *
   * Consider the following example with 2 functions (an SQL function and a PLPGSQL function):
   *
   * CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_rows() RETURNS TABLE(z VARCHAR(100))
   *  ...
   *  ...
   *  SELECT * from t;
   *
   * CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE outer_func() LANGUAGE PLPGSQL
   *  ...
   *  ...
   *  FOR target IN SELECT get_rows() LOOP
   *    ....
   *
   * In outer_func, there is a FOR LOOP that iterates over the results of the get_rows SQL function.
   * One way to perform this execution would be to fetch all records of the last SELECT statement in
   * get_rows() and store them in memory. Then, the FOR LOOP can perform each iteration on a new row
   * picked from memory. However, this requires using a possibly large amount of memory. Also, in
   * case the FOR LOOP was to exit early based on some condition, the rest of the rows stored in
   * memory would be rendered useless along with the computation that was done to fetch them in the
   * get_rows function. For this reason, Postgres allows SQL functions which have a SELECT statement
   * at the end to be lazily evaluable. This means that the function allows a caller to request rows
   * one at a time -- hence removing the need for the function to fetch all rows of that SELECT and
   * store in memory.
   *
   * Note that in READ COMMITTED isolation, each statement in a volatile function runs on a new
   * snapshot. Lazy evaluation requires executing a function's last SELECT statement partially
   * multiple times. But all rows from a lazily evaluated SELECT statement should always correspond
   * to a consistent snapshot. But, other execution in the backend between two calls to a lazily
   * evaluable function might require running on a newer snapshot. Postgres handles this by storing
   * snapshot information in the lazy function's execution state and switching back to that snapshot
   * when context moves back to the function to fetch more rows. The below code is where Postgres
   * switches back to a saved snapshot when re-entering a lazily evaluated function -
   *
   * /* Re-establish active snapshot when re-entering function ...
   * PushActiveSnapshot(es->qd->snapshot);
   *
   * In YB, a consistent read point is the analogue of a snapshot. The information about a
   * consistent read point is maintained in pg_client_session.cc on the tserver process of the same
   * node. Only one consistent read point can be stored for a transaction at a single point in time.
   * YSQL is allowed to change the consistent read point in limited ways: change it to the current
   * time as seen by the tserver process, set it to the restart read time it in case of a read
   * restart or update it to a specific value in case of backfill. But YSQL doesn't have the
   * capability to read the consistent read point that is chosen by the tserver process if set to
   * the current time. So, it is not possible to switch back to the consistent read point of a
   * lazily evaluated query.
   *
   * This limitation results in later invocations of a lazily evaluated query to possibly use later
   * consistent read points that were set as part of other execution between invocations to the
   * lazily evaluated query. This breaks correctness since the data now doesn't correspond to a
   * single snapshot.
   *
   * This limitation will be addressed in #12959. Till we add the necessary framework to allow
   * saving and reusing snapshots, YSQL disables lazy evaluation in READ COMMITTED isolation to
   * avoid correctness issues that can stem from not using a single snapshot for a lazily evaluated
   * query.
