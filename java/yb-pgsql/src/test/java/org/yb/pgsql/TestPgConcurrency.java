/**
 * This test suite is to test features such as ACID transaction properties, requiring multiple
 * concurrent transactions. It contains helper classes making it easier to run parallel clients
 * doing predefined tasks: modify the database, read modified data and make sure the data remain
 * consistent at all times.
 *
 * By the nature of concurrent processes it is not guaranteed the tests reproduce the problems
 * 100% of times, but hopefully they are useful to catch regressions.
 *
 * Note: the helper classes are implemented as inner classes initially, but if (or when) we have
 * more tests of that kind, and need more test suites, we can (and should) refactor them into a

   * on top of the SELECT plan and assigns the pseudo-constant condition to it. At execution time
   * the condition is evaluated, and, if false, the SELECT plan is not executed.
   *
   * However, such a construction may make the INSERT statement mistaken for a single row insert.
   * Single row inserts are committed and visible immediately, so concurrent read have a chance to
   * see part of the rows inserted by a statement.
