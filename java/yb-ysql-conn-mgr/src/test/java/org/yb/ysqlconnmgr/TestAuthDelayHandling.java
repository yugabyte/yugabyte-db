    // This test ensures that the fix added for #28080 and #28231 is working as
    // intended. The fix catches clients who have timed out before authentication
    // has begun and abandons the auth attempt for these clients, skipping
    // expensive steps like backend spin-up and catalogue cache refresh.

    // For this test, conn mgr has a delay added during authentication of 5 sec.
    // The test launches 2N + 1 thread attempting to connect to conn mgr.
    // The first 2N of these are intended to timeout after 1 sec of no messages
    // from conn mgr, while the last one will timeout after 7.5 seconds (and
    // sleeps for 2.5 seconds before attempting a connection). (Here, N = 19)

    // The first N threads will occupy the available physical connections and 'hang up'
    // during auth (because of the auth delay flag). Technically, they will see the password
    // request from the server and close the socket. But because conn mgr is stuck in
    // a machine_sleep call due to the flag, it will not see the closed socket until
    // it wakes up from sleep.

    // The next N threads will timeout while waiting  in the routing queue. Upon hitting
    // the socket timeout, they will close the socket (hence the custom socket factory) and exit.
    // We expect conn mgr to check this and handle the closed sockets by abandoning
    // auth for them, allowing the final thread to complete authentication successfully.

    // If conn mgr does not catch the timed out queued clients, it will proceed to
    // attempt authentication for already timed out clients, causing further clients
    // to also time out (here, the 1 expectSuccess thread), causing a
    // 'cascade of timeouts'.
