Run build first.

Run individual tests like

    pg15_tests/test_D29226.sh fastdebug --gcc11

Run a test n times like

    pg15_tests/run_test_n_times.sh pg15_tests/test_D29226.sh 10 debug --clang15

Run all tests once like

    pg15_tests/run_shell_tests.sh fastdebug --clang16
    pg15_tests/run_passing_cxx_tests.sh fastdebug --clang16
    pg15_tests/run_passing_java_tests.sh fastdebug --clang16

Add passing tests into passing_cxx.tsv or passing_java.tsv.

Add shell tests by adding a new test_*.sh file following the existing
conventions.

Make sure new tests pass 10x in a row to avoid introducing flaky tests, and
make sure all tests pass (at least once) to avoid regressions.  Note: it may be
more convenient to use jenkins to cover passing tests:

    pg15_tests/run_shell_tests.sh fastdebug --clang16
    # ...and trigger jenkins

In the later stages of pg15, there will be no more need for these tests because
the underlying tests will pass.

(When, in the future, deactivating these tests, don't forget to remove the line
in .arclint.)
